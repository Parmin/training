"*I thought I was on my development machine and I've accidentally dropped a
collection in production.*"

Your data is backed up in MMS, so you can recover all the data that existed
immediately before the drop.  You'll need to request a point-in-time backup and
then restore it.

The collection is ``test.users`` and the total number of documents
prior to the drop was 20,000.
