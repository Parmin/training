MongoDB Training
================

Introduction
------------

This project is a comprehensive revision of MongoDB training materials
used for the following classes:

-  MongoDB Essentials Training
-  MongoDB Developer Training
-  MongoDB Admin Training

The build environment has many dependencies. We recommend you download
the `instructor package`_ (last built 8 November 2014) which
contains the most recent build of all materials. See the Test-Driving
Built Materials section below for instructions on using the materials.

**Reviews are nearly complete. We are now field testing.** 

Objectives
----------

-  To support instructors in learning and delivering MongoDB trainings
   by providing the following resources:

   -  A easily-navigated instructor guide complete with outline, training
      content, and instructor notes

   -  Figures, slides, exercises, and notes for delivery in class

   -  A workbook to be distributed to students to enable them to easily
      follow lessons and exercises and take notes

-  Training materials that are easier to maintain and that encourage
   contributions in the form of pull requests from those who deliver
   MongoDB training and others in the company

-  Modular materials for greater flexibility in how trainings are
   organized

Status
------

Currently, there are drafts of all planned sections, including:

-  Introduction
-  CRUD
-  Indexes
-  Aggregation
-  Data Modeling
-  Replica Sets
-  Sharding
-  Security

We may need to write a section on performance.

Test-Driving Built Materials
----------------------------

Download the `instructor package`_ (last built 8 November 2014).
This package contains the instructor guide and presentation slides.

Extract the files in the tarball and open the contents.html file in a
web browser.

The nav on the left enables instructors to browse the modules in the
instructor guide. Each subsection is designed to be one slideâ€™s worth of
material.

For presentation to students, we have deployed a version of these
materials in the form of slides. To see the deck for a given module,
navigate to that module in the instructor guide and click the slides
link at the bottom of the navigation pane.

This will bring up another browser window containing html-based slides.
These decks respond to keyboard events such as arrow keys and the space
bar in the same way as Microsoft Powerpoint.
