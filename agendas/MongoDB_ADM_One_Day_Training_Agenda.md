# MongoDB Advanced Data Modeling

<img src="img/mongodb-university-logo.png" class="floatright single" style="width: 100px">

## Overview

Due to greater flexibility in MongoDB, schemas, queries, and indexes often require more consideration than with an RDBMS. A de-normalized data model (as used by most MongoDB systems) has many advantages; however, designing such a model requires careful consideration of use cases. In this one-day course, students will learn how to optimize a data model to support specific data access patterns in a variety of common application types. Students will explore advanced schema design patterns with the MongoDB document model, group exercises for learning the patterns, and cases studies for these design patterns.
