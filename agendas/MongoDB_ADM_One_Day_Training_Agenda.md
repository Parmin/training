## Overview

Schemas, queries, and indexes for MongoDB often include more considerations than an RDBMS, and different methods must be used.  Designing a de-normalized data model (as used by most MongoDB systems) has many advantages, however, this model can add many more design options than a relational model and a lot of care must be taken.  This course starts with an introduction to the MongoDB query language and document model.  The course then continues with design patterns for a number of application use cases in MongoDB: time series data, managing hierarchical data, fanout on read/writes, to name a few.
