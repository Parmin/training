## Overview

Schemas, queries, and indexes for MongoDB often include more considerations than an RDBMS, and different methods must be used.  Designing a de-normalized data model (as used by most MongoDB systems) has many advantages, however, this model can add many more design options than a relational model and a lot of care must be taken.  This course focuses on advanced schema design patterns with the MongoDB document model, group exercises for learning the patterns, and cases studies for these design patterns.
