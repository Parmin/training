# MongoDB Advanced Data Modeling

<img src="img/mongodb-university-logo.png" class="floatright single" style="width: 100px">

## Overview

MongoDB provides a high degree of flexibility in designing data models. Therefore, MongoDB schemas, queries, and indexes often require more consideration than with an RDBMS. A de-normalized data model (as used by most MongoDB systems) has many advantages; however, designing such a model requires careful consideration of use cases. In this one-day course, students will learn to optimize a data model to support specific data access patterns in a variety of common application types. Students will explore advanced schema design patterns with the MongoDB document model, group exercises for learning the patterns, and cases studies for these design patterns.

### Introduction to Schema Design with the MongoDB Document Model

* Designing a CMS in MongoDB vs. an RDBMS
* Optimizing for the use case
* Managing application requirements

### Schema Design Concepts

* Schema design core concepts
* Measuring performance
* Schema evolution (versioning schema)
* Read preference and write concern

### Exercise: Application Requirements

Students will work in groups, with each group focusing on a different type of application. The specific applications selected for this training depend on the teams being trained.

* Review high-level application requirements
* Translate requirements to low-level design considerations
* Share and discuss results


### Common Schema Design Patterns

* Time-series Data
* Trees
* Worker Queues
* Fan Out on Read/Write
* CMS

### Exercise: Application Schema Design

Building on the work from the previous exercise, each student group will extend their application designs.

* Consider query patterns
* Design a data model
* Design indexes
* Share and discuss results

### Schema Design Cases Studies

* Ad-tech application (time-series data)
* Social networking (fan out on read/write)
* Large apparel (product catalog, single view of customer)

### Schema Design Group Exercise

The instructor and students will review a large-scale application. The specific application depends on the team being trained.

* Assign individual application components to student groups
* Each group will develop a complete schema design for their components, including indexes
* Share and discuss individual designs and integration
