Instructions:
=============
1) Put the list of profiles you work with in 'profiles.txt'.
   Put the region on which you want to run the majority of your tests as the first entry.
     Some tests will be run only against this one
   I suggest you create profiles matching those names for simplicity.

tests
=====

create_runs.sh
  create a minimum cluster in a list of regions
    - test that the key/pairs are working in each region
    - test that the AMIs are available in each supported region

describe_stacks_all_regions.sh
  use 'describe' to see if all regions can be looked at, and got runs created

access_hosts.sh
  use 'manage' to test the access to each machine

destroy_runs.sh
  remove all the runs from the 'create_runs.sh'
