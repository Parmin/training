Introduction
------------

This project is a comprehensive revision of MongoDB training materials used for the following classes:

- MongoDB Essentials Training
- MongoDB Developer Training
- MongoDB Admin Training

**These materials are not yet ready for use. They are drafts requiring further refinement and corrections.** Pull requests and email to [training@mongodb.com](mailto:training@mongodb.com) are welcome.


Objectives
----------

- To support instructors in learning and delivering MongoDB trainings by providing the following resources:

  - A easily-navigated instructor guide complete with outline, training content, and instructor notes
  - Figures, slides, exercises, and notes for delivery in class
  - A workbook to be distributed to students to enable them to easily follow lessons and exercises and take notes

- Training materials that are easier to maintain and that encourage contributions in the form of pull requests from those who deliver MongoDB training and others in the company
- Modular materials for greater flexibility in how trainings are organized

Test-Driving Built Materials
----------------------------

Download the [instructor package](https://s3.amazonaws.com/edu-static.mongodb.com/training/instructor-package.tar.gz). This package contains the instructor guide and presentation slides.

Extract the files in the tarball and open the contents.html file in a web browser.

The nav on the left enables instructors to browse the modules in the instructor guide. Each subsection is designed to be one slide's worth of material.

For presentation to students, we have deployed a version of these materials in the form of slides. To see the deck for a given module, navigate to that module in the instructor guide and click the slides link at the bottom of the navigation pane.

This will bring up another browser window containing html-based slides. These decks respond to keyboard events such as arrow keys and the space bar in the same way as Microsoft Powerpoint. **Styling is not finalized on slides, though what we currently have isn't bad.**

Returning to the instuctor guide, note that many subsections (i.e. slides) contain notes to the instructor. These are identified by a green box labeled "NOTE:".

These are also available as presenter notes in the presenter's console for slides. **To activate the presenter's console, type the 'c' character while viewing a slide deck.** The slides window must have focus. Instructor notes, if they exist, appear below a slide in the presenter console.

You may advance slides in either the presenter console or the slide deck itself. They are synced.

Please explore the instructor guide, slides, and presenter's console.
