TODO Agg :

Script data insert


Backup :

- POSSIBLE: Have a web application that allows users to log in. Show the login of a user to the class. Then drop the collection, and try and log in again. Show them that you cannot log in. Ask them to investigate.


TODO ASAP Perf:

Scipt the following:

	db.live.ensureIndex({"user.name":1})
	db.live.ensureIndex({"user.time_zone":1})





POSSIBLE - Replication ideas :

Diagnose why an app is taking a while to do a write. It will be a slave delay node and a w:3 write concern.

Expanding a replica set - bringing a new secondary up and ensuring it has warm data before adding it to the set to prevent a full sync

Conflict resolution


Sharding ideas:

POSSIBLE: Collection pre-splitting




Meeting Ideas : 

	- 





TODO in near future EC2
