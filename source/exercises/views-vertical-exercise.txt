Lab: Vertical Views
===================



Exercise: Vertical View Creation
--------------------------------

It is useful to create vertical views to give us a lens into a subset of our overall data.

- Use the aggregation framework to create a vertical view of our dataset.
- Start by importing the necessary data if you have not already.
- You will need to untar the dataset

.. code-block:: bash

   tar xvzf views_dataset.tar.gz

.. code-block:: bash

   # for version >= 3.4
   mongoimport -d companies -c complaints --drop views_dataset.json

To help you verify your work, there are 404816 entries in this dataset.

      .. code-block:: javascript

      	use companies;
        db.complaints.count() // 404816

Once you've verified the data import was successful, create a view that only reflects
consumer complaints in New York, ordered from most recently to least recently received.
The resulting data should look like:
