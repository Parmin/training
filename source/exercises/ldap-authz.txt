===================================================
Lab: LDAP Authentication & Authorization (Optional)
===================================================

Premise
-------

- Authentication and authorization with an external service (like LDAP) is an
  important functionality for large organizations that rely on centralized user
  management tools.

- This lab is designed to get you familiar with the procedure to run a
  ``mongod`` with authentication and authorization enabled with an external
  LDAP service.

  .. note::

    - Take this opportunity to setup your OpenLDAP VM which students will
      connect to.
      
      1. Download and extract `ldapserver.tar.gz`_ 
      2. Run the following commands:

        .. code-block:: bash
          
          $ vagrant up
          $ vagrant ssh

      3. You can confirm that everything is up and running correctly by
         running:

        .. code-block:: bash
          
          $ ldapwhoami -vvv -H ldapi:/// -D 'uid=alice,ou=Users,dc=mongodb,dc=com' -x -w secret


Test Connection to LDAP
-----------------------

- An LDAP server is up and running for you to connect to.

- **Server Info**:

  - **Server Address**: ``192.168.19.100:8389``
  - **User**: ``uid=alice,ou=Users,dc=mongodb,dc=com``
  - **Password**: ``secret``

.. include:: /includes/student-notes.rst

.. only:: instructor

  .. note::

    - Make sure to update the IP above with your computer's own local IP
      address.

    - We're using ``8389`` instead of the default LDAP port of ``389`` because
      we need to forward the port from our VM to our host machine so students
      can access the OpenLDAP server.


Test Connection to LDAP (cont'd)
--------------------------------

- Your goal is to fill in the following configuration file and get
  ``mongoldap`` to successfully talk to the LDAP server with the following
  command:

.. code-block:: bash
  
  $ mongoldap --config mongod.conf --user alice --password secret

.. code-block:: yaml

  ...
  security:
    authorization: "enabled"
    ldap:
      servers: "XXXXXXXXXXXXXX:8389"
      authz:
        queryTemplate: "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
      userToDNMapping: '[{match: "XXXX", substitution: "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"}]'
      transportSecurity: "none"
      bind:
        method: "simple"
  setParameter:
      authenticationMechanisms: PLAIN

.. include:: /includes/student-notes.rst

.. only:: instructor

  .. note::

    - The key to this exercise is to build a correct ``queryTemplate`` and
      ``userToDNMapping``.

    - The correct missing parts of the config are:

      .. code-block:: yaml

        security:
          ldap:
            servers: "192.168.19.100" // students will update with your local IP, currently this is the IP of the VM
            authz:
              queryTemplate: "ou=Users,dc=mongodb,dc=com??one?(member={USER})"
            userToDNMapping: '[{match: "(.+)", substitution: "uid={0},ou=Users,dc=mongodb,dc=com"}]'

    - Inside `ldapserver.tar.gz`_ there is a sample ``mongod.conf`` that should
      be able to talk to the LDAP server.


Authentication with LDAP
------------------------

- Once you've successfully connected to LDAP with ``mongoldap`` you should be
  able to use the same config file with ``mongod``.

  .. code-block:: bash
    
    $ mongod --config mongod.conf
    
- From here you should be able to authenticate with ``alice`` and ``secret``.

  .. code-block:: bash
    
    $ mongo --username alice \
            --password secret \
            --authenticationMechanism PLAIN \
            --authenticationDatabase '$external'

.. include:: /includes/student-notes.rst

.. only:: instructor

  .. note::

    - The following command will test your connection to the OpenLDAP server

      .. code-block:: bash
        
        $ mongoldap --config mongod.conf --user alice --password secret


Authorization with LDAP
-----------------------

- After successfully *authenticating* with LDAP, you'll need to take advantage
  of the **localhost exception** to enable *authorization* with LDAP.

- Create a role that allows anyone who is apart of the
  **cn=admins,ou=Users,dc=mongodb,dc=com** LDAP group to be able to manage
  users (e.g., inheriting ``userAdminAnyDatabase``).

- To confirm that you've successfully setup authorization the following command
  should execute without error if you're authenticated as ``alice`` since she's
  apart of the group.

  .. code-block:: bash
    
    > use admin
    > db.getRoles()

.. include:: /includes/student-notes.rst

.. only:: instructor

  .. note::

    - The following command will create the necessary role.

      .. code-block:: bash
        
        > db.createRole({
            role: 'cn=admins,ou=Users,dc=mongodb,dc=com',
            privileges: [],
            roles:['userAdminAnyDatabase']
          });
