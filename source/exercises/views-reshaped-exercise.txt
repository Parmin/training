===================
Lab: Reshaped Views
===================



Exercise: Reshaped View
-----------------------
We can create a reshaped view from a collection to enable more intuitive data
queries and make it easier for applications to perform analytics.

It is also possible to create a view from a view. While not necessary,
we will do so for this exercise.

- Use the aggregation framework to create a reshaped view of our dataset.
- It is necessary to have completed the Horizontal View Lab.

Exercise : Reshaped View Specification
--------------------------------------

Create a view that can be queried by company name that shows the amount of complaints by state.
The resulting data should look like:

.. code-block:: javascript

  db.companyComplaintsByState.find({"company": "ROCKY MOUNTAIN MORTGAGE COMPANY"})

  {
	  "company" : "ROCKY MOUNTAIN MORTGAGE COMPANY",
	  "states" : [
	    {
	    	 "state" : "TX",
	    	 "count" : 4
	    }
	  ]
  }

.. only:: instructor

  .. note::

      .. code-block:: javascript

      	use companies;
        db.createView("companyComplaintsByState", "productComplaints", [
          {
            $group: {
              "_id": {
                  company: "$company",
                  state: "$state"
              },
              count: {
                  $sum: 1
              }
            }
          }, {
            $group: {
              "_id": "$_id.company",
              "byState": {
                "$push": {
                  "state": "$_id.state",
                  "count": "$count"
                }
              }
            }
          }, {
            $project: {
              _id: 0,
              "company": "$_id",
              "states": "$byState"
            }
          }
        ])
