Exercise: Create an Admin User
------------------------------

- Launch a mongo shell.
- Create a user with the role, ``userAdminAnyDatabase`` 
- Use name "Roland" and password "12345".
- Enable this user to login on the admin database.
- Demonstrate a login.

.. only:: instructor

   .. note::

      .. code-block:: javascript

         use admin
         var role = "userAdminAnyDatabase"
         var name = "Roland"
         var password = "12345"
         newUserDoc = { user : name,
                        pwd : password,
                        roles : [ { role : role,
                                    db : "admin" } ] }
         db.createUser( newUserDoc )
         exit

      And now, to log back in:

      .. code-block:: bash

         mongo -u Roland admin -p

      Remember:
      
      - Once a user is created, the localhost exception no longer applies.
      - If that first user can't create other users, you will be extremely limited in your ability
