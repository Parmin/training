Exercise: Create an Admin User, Part 2
--------------------------------------

- Launch a mongo shell without logging in.
- Attempt to create a user.
- Exit the shell.
- Log in again as roland.
- Ensure that you can create a user.

.. only:: instructor

   .. note::

      .. code-block:: bash

         mongo -u roland admin -p

      Remember:
      
      - Once a user is created, the localhost exception no longer applies.
      - If that first user can't create other users, you will be extremely limited in your ability
