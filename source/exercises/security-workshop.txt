Lab: Security Workshop
======================

.. only:: instructor

  .. note::

     - We assume you are familiar with the provisioning scripts. If not start with:
       https://docs.google.com/document/d/17asAf_1lrj5lUynl6RdyrRekQeGbvsAW5ZV3F3FM3cA

     - You will provision 4 nodes per team/attendee, using the provisioning script.
       For example, for a 9 team/attendee exercise, you would run:

       .. code-block:: sh

          deploy.py --profile mdbw-security --teams 9 --instances 4 --noom --run INSTRUCTOR-StetsonD

     - 3 nodes for the replica set, 1 node for the client application
     - Replace INSTRUCTOR with your name, and StetsonD with the room you are presenting in
     - The attendees will have to:

      - setup SSL with the client certificates
      - setup auth
      - enable encryption at rest
      - enable log redaction

     - Each successive objective of this workshop requires full completion of previous objectives.
     Ensure all participants have met the requirements of a specific section before proceeding.

    - TODOs:

      - consider "Solution: Enable SSL with the client" being a separate exercise
        that is done later, as it is more difficult
      - consider adding "bonus exercises" for people who finish earlier: things
        like generating your own certificates


Learning Objectives
-------------------

Upon completing this workshop, attendees will be able to:

- Secure application communication with MongoDB
- Understand all security authentication and authorization options of MongoDB
- Encrypt MongoDB data at rest using encrypted storage engine
- Feel comfortable deploying and securely configuring MongoDB

.. include:: /includes/student-notes.rst


Introduction
------------

In this workshop attendees will install and configure a secure replica set on 
servers running in AWS.


- We are going to secure the backend communications using TLS/SSL
- Enable authorization on the backend side
- Encrypt the storage layer
- Make sure that there are no *"leaks"* of information

.. include:: /includes/student-notes.rst

.. only:: instructor

  .. note::

    Describe to the students the different components of this workshop.

    - The application code in "security-lab/mongo-messenger"
    - The 3 AWS instances where the backend should be running
    - The single AWS instance where the node app should run
    - The set of available files in "/share/downloads":

      - mongodb_packages => MongoDB binaries
      - certs  => X509 certificates
      - config => Configuration files

    - How to install and start MongoDB on the instances using the package
    - Provide the students with the following files:

      - AdvancedAdministrator.pem
      - Info per team about IPs, hostnames, ... from running "describe.py --run security_workshop"
      - certs.tgz


.. include:: /includes/connecting-aws-instances.txt


Exercise: Starting MongoDB and configuring the replica set
----------------------------------------------------------

- ``/share/downloads/mongodb_packages`` contains MongoDB 3.2 and 3.4
- installation instructions are at:

  - https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-enterprise-on-red-hat/

- configure the 3 nodes as a replica set named **SECURED**
- use ``node1``, ``node2`` and ``node3`` for your host names
- you *MUST* use a config file


Starting MongoDB and configuring the replica set (cont)
-------------------------------------------------------

.. rst-class:: longlist

- installation

  .. code-block:: sh

     sudo yum install -y mongodb-enterprise-server-3.4.2-1.el7.x86_64.rpm
     sudo vi /etc/mongod.conf
     sudo service mongod start

- configure the 3 nodes as a replica set named **SECURED**,
  change **bindIp** to the **10.0.0.X** address, plus **127.0.0.1**

  .. code-block:: sh

     replication:
         replSetName: SECURED
     net:
         bindIp: 10.0.0.101,127.0.0.1

- initiate the replica set

  .. code-block:: sh

     cfg = { _id: "SECURED", version: 1, members: [ {_id: 0, host: "node1:27017"}, {_id: 1, host: "node2:27017"}, {_id:2, host: "node3:27017"} ] }
     rs.initiate(cfg)
     rs.status()


Exercise: Check the Connection to MongoDB
-----------------------------------------

Let's try to connect to our running MongoDB cluster.

.. code-block:: sh

    mongo --host SECURED/node1,node2,node3

.. include:: /includes/student-notes.rst

.. only:: instructor

  .. note::

    - Here we want to make sure everyone can connect correctly to the MongoDB
    cluster.
    - A student may ask why there are no primaries in the replica set. This is
    most likely because they've reached this step quickly and an election is still
    taking place


Exercise: Launch the Client Application
---------------------------------------

It's time connect our client application.

- install node.js

.. code-block:: sh

    sudo yum install -y epel-release
    sudo yum install -y nodejs

- install the application:

.. code-block:: sh

    cd ~
    tar xzvf /share/downloads/apps/security_lab.tgz
    cd mongo-messenger
    npm install
    npm start

- connect to your application with a browser on port 8080

.. include:: /includes/student-notes.rst

.. only:: instructor

  .. note::

    The sample application code should be available in the AWS instance.
    In case students cannot find it, they can download using this instruction:

    .. code-block:: sh

        curl -O https://s3.amazonaws.com/mongodb-training/security_lab/security_lab.tgz

    Also, make sure all instances have ``nodejs`` installed.


How is the client application connecting to the database?
---------------------------------------------------------

- the connection string used by the application is in ``message.js`` and looks like this:

.. code-block:: sh

   const url = "mongodb://node1:27017,node2:27017,node3:27017/
       security-lab?replicaSet=SECURED"

- this is good for now, however you may have to change it later in the lab


WARNING: Spying your deployment!
--------------------------------

Throughout the lab, the instructor will be spying on your deployment!

This checking is done by running a few scripts on your machines that will verify
whether or not you have completely secured your deployment.

We will come back to this later on.

.. include:: /includes/student-notes.rst

.. only:: instructor

  .. note::

    At this point you should run the lab validation scripts against one of the
    students environment to test which things are not yet secured.

    - run any arbitrary command. Try the following first, as that first run may
      fail due to the fact that is has to add the hostname to ```known_hosts``.

      .. code-block:: sh

         ./manage.py --run NathanL-StetsonD --teams all --roles node1,node2,node3 --cmd "/bin/hostname -f"
         ./manage.py --run NathanL-StetsonD --teams all --roles node1,node2,node3 --cmd "python /share/downloads/validation/validate_log_redaction.py"
         ./manage.py --run NathanL-StetsonD --teams all --roles node1,node2,node3 --cmd "sudo python /share/downloads/validation/validate_se_encryption.py"


Exercise: Set up Authentication and Authorization
-------------------------------------------------

Once we have our sample application up an running is time to start securing the
system.

You should start by enabling `MongoDB authentication`_ and `MongoDB authorization`_

To do this, you will have to decide:

- Which authentication mechanism to use
- Which authorization support will you use
- Set of users required to operate this system

.. _`MongoDB authentication`: https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/authentication/
.. _`MongoDB authorization`: https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/authorization/

.. include:: /includes/student-notes.rst

.. only:: instructor

  .. note::

    At this stage we will have the students making decisions regarding the
    authentication and authorization mechanisms available, and which better
    suits their needs.

    Ask questions like:

    - Which authentication mechanisms should we be setting up?

      - Remind students that we will want the application to be fully encrypted

    - Which systems should we have in place to manage users?

      - What happens if we decide to have more than one application in this system?
      - What will happen if we need to remove


.. only:: instructor

  Solution: Enable authorization
  ------------------------------

  - using the localhost exception, create the first user

  .. code-block:: sh

     use admin
     db.createUser({
       user: "foo",
       pwd: "bar",
       roles: [{role: "root", db: "admin"}]
     })
     use security-lab
     db.createUser({
       user: "mongo-messenger",
       pwd: "nodejs",
       roles: [{role: "readWrite", db: "security-lab"}]
     })


    - must be able to create other users

  - need to change "Mongo Messenger" to auth with a given user


Exercise: Enable SSL between the nodes
--------------------------------------

- we restricted "bindIp" to a local network interface,
  however if this was an outside address, it would not be good enough
- let's ensure we limit the connections to a list of nodes we control

  - let's use SSL certificates
  - they are in ``/share/downloads/certs``

- http://mongodb.github.io/node-mongodb-native/2.2/tutorials/connect/ssl/

.. only:: instructor

  Solution: Enable SSL between the nodes
  --------------------------------------

  - add SSL

  .. code-block:: sh

     net:
       ssl:
         mode: requireSSL
         PEMKeyFile: /etc/ssl/mongodb/node1.pem
         CAFile: /etc/ssl/mongodb/ca.pem
     security:
       clusterAuthMode: x509

  - restart all running mongod's
  - connect with the client

  .. code-block:: sh

     mongo --ssl --host node1 --sslCAFile /etc/ssl/mongodb/ca.pem --sslPEMKeyFile /etc/ssl/mongodb/node1.pem

  Solution: Enable SSL with the client
  ------------------------------------

  - In ``~/mongo-messenger/messages.js``

  .. code-block:: javascript
          
      const fs = require('fs');

      // Read the certificates and create ssl options object
      let ca = [fs.readFileSync('/etc/ssl/mongodb/ca.pem')];
      let cert = fs.readFileSync('/etc/ssl/mongodb/node1.pem');
      let key = fs.readFileSync('/etc/ssl/mongodb/node1.pem');
      let options = {
        sslValidate:true,
        sslCA:ca,
        sslCert:cert,
        sslKey:key
      }
      // mongo-messenger user
      let user = encodeURIComponent('mongo-messenger');
      let pass = encodeURIComponent('nodejs');
      let db = 'security-lab';
      const url = `mongodb://${user}:${pass}@node1:27017,node2:27017,node3:27017/${db}?authSource=${db}&replicaSet=SECURED&ssl=true`

      let messages = null;

      MongoClient.connect(url, options, (err, db) => {
        assert.equal(null, err)
        messages = db.collection("messages")
      })


Exercise: Encrypt Storage Layer
-------------------------------

To fully secure our MongoDB deployment we need to consider the actual MongoDB
instance files.
Your instructor has some scripts that will enable him to have a peek into the
your collection and indexes data files.

Don't let him do so!!!

.. include:: /includes/student-notes.rst


.. only:: instructor

  Solution: Encrypt Storage Layer
  -------------------------------

  - enable encryption on the storage engine

  .. code-block:: yaml

     security:
       enableEncryption: true
       encryptionKeyFile: /etc/ssl/mongodb/mongodb-keyfile

  - different options to manage encryption keys, however for this lab a simple keyfile should have been enough

  .. code-block:: sh

     openssl rand -base64 32 > mongodb-keyfile
     chmod 600 mongodb-keyfile

  https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/configure-encryption/


Exercise: Avoid any log leaks
-----------------------------

Logs are an important asset of your system.

Allow us to understand any potential issue with our cluster or deployment.
But they can also **leak** some confidential information!

Make sure that you do not have any data leaks into your logs.

This should be done without downtime

.. include:: /includes/student-notes.rst

.. only:: instructor

  .. note::

     At this point students should enable log redaction in their cluster nodes.

     To accomplish this students should do the following:

     - relaunch all nodes enabling client log data redaction

     - Give "extra kudos" to students that managed to do this and also clearing
       any information on previous logs


.. only:: instructor

  Solution: Avoid any log leaks
  -----------------------------

  by setting up log redaction

  .. code-block:: yaml

     security:
       redactClientLogData: true

  .. code-block:: sh

     db.adminCommand(
       { setParameter: 1, redactClientLogData : true }
     )

  - and you need a way to prove/show that redaction worked


Putting it together
-------------------

.. code-block:: yaml

   net:
     ssl:
       mode: requireSSL
       PEMKeyFile: /etc/ssl/mongodb/node1.pem
       CAFile: /etc/ssl/mongodb/ca.pem

   security:
     authorization: enabled
     clusterAuthMode: x509
     enableEncryption : true
     encryptionKeyFile : /etc/ssl/mongodb/mongodb-keyfile
     redactClientLogData: true


Summary
-------

What we did:

- enabled basic authorization
- used SSL certificates
- encrypted the database at rest
- redacted the mongod logs

.. only:: instructor

  .. note::

    Ask what else could be done?

    - MongoDB

      - link authorization and authentication to outside system like LDAP or Kerberos
      - enable redaction of results

    - Infrastructure

      - use security groups if in AWS
      - use firewall

   - Application

     - security at the application level
