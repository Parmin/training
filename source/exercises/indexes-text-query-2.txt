Exercise: Querying Using Two Words
----------------------------------

- Find all documents in the montyPython collection with either the word 'coconut' or 'swallow'.
- By default MongoDB ORs query terms together.
- E.g., if you query on two words, results include documents using either word.

.. code-block:: javascript

   // Finds 4 documents, 3 of which contain only one of the two words.   
   db.montyPython.find( { $text : { $search : "coconut swallow" } } )

.. include:: /includes/student-notes.rst
