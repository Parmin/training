===========================================
Lab: Finding and Addressing Slow Operations
===========================================

Set Up
------

- In this exercise let's bring up a ``mongo`` shell with the following
  instructions

.. code-block:: sh

  mongo --shell localhost/performance performance.js

In the shell that launches execute the following method

.. code-block:: js

  performance.init()


Exercise: Determine Indexes Needed
----------------------------------

.. rst-class:: longlist

- In a mongo shell run ``performance.b()``. This will run in an infinite loop
  printing some output as it runs various statements against the server.
- Now imagine we have detected a performance problem and suspect there is a slow
  operation running.
- Find the slow operation and terminate it. Every slow operation is assumed to
  run for 100ms or more.
- In order to do this, open a second window (or tab) and run a second instance
  of the mongo shell.
- What indexes can we introduce to make the slow queries more efficient?
  Disregard the index created in the previous exercises.

.. only:: instructor

   .. note::

      - Look at the logs to find queries over 100ms
      - { "active": 1 }
      - { "str": 1, "x": 1 }
