Lab: Finding and Addressing Slow Operations
===========================================


Exercise: Determine Indexes Needed 
----------------------------------

- In a mongo shell run ``performance.b()``. This will run in an infinite loop printing some output as it runs various statements against the server.
- Now imagine we have detected a performance problem and suspect there is a slow operation running.
- Find the slow operation and terminate it. Every slow operation is assumed to run for 100ms or more.
- In order to do this, open a second window (or tab) and run a second instance of the mongo shell.
- What indexes can we introduce to make the slow queries more efficient? Disregard the index created in the previous exercise.

      - Look at the logs to find queries over 100ms
      - { "active": 1 } 
      - { "str": 1, "x": 1 }
