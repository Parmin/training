Production Releases
-------------------

64-bit production releases of MongoDB are available for the following platforms.

- Windows
- OSX
- Linux
- Solaris

.. include:: /includes/student-notes.rst

.. include:: /includes/np.rst

Installing MongoDB
------------------

- Visit http://www.mongodb.org/downloads
- Download and install the appropriate package for your machine.
- Even-numbered builds are production releases, e.g., 2.4.x, 2.6.x.
- Odd-numbers indicate development releases, e.g., 2.5.x, 2.7.x.
- 32-bit versions should NOT be used in production (limited to 2GB of data). They are acceptable for training classes.

Setup
-----

.. code-block:: bash

   PATH=$PATH:path_to_mongodb/bin

   sudo mkdir /data/db

   sudo chmod 770 /data/db

.. include:: /includes/student-notes.rst

.. only:: instructor

   .. note::

      - You might want to add the MongoDB bin directory to your path, e.g.
      - Once installed, create the MongoDB data directory.
      - Make sure you have write permission on this directory.


.. include:: /includes/np.rst

Launch a ``mongod``
-------------------

.. code-block:: bash

   /<path_to_mongodb>/bin/mongod --help

   /<path_to_mongodb>/bin/mongod

.. include:: /includes/student-notes.rst

.. only:: instructor

   .. note::

      - Open a command shell and explore the mongod command.
      - Then run mongodb.

.. only:: instructor

   .. note::

      - Please verify that all students have successfully installed MongoDB.
      - Please verify that all can successfully launch a mongod.


Import Exercise Data
--------------------

.. code-block:: bash

   cd usb_drive

   unzip sampledata.zip

   cd sampledata 

   mongoimport -d sample -c tweets twitter.json

   mongoimport -d sample -c zips zips.json

   cd dump 

   mongorestore -d sample training

   mongorestore -d sample digg

.. include:: /includes/student-notes.rst

.. only:: instructor

   .. note::
      
      - Import the data provided on the USB drive into the *sample* database.


.. include:: /includes/np.rst

Launch a Mongo Shell
--------------------

Open another command shell. Then type the following to start the Mongo shell.

.. code-block:: bash
  
   mongo

Display available commands.

.. code-block:: bash

   help

.. include:: /includes/student-notes.rst


Explore Databases
-----------------

Display available databases.

.. code-block:: bash

   show dbs

To use a particular database we can type the following.

.. code-block:: bash
 
   use <database_name>

   db

.. include:: /includes/student-notes.rst

.. only:: instructor

   .. note::

      - This assigns the variable :js:data:`db` to a connection object for the selected database. 
      - We can display the name of the database we are currently using by evaluating :js:data:`db` in the mongo shell.
      - Highlight the power of the Mongo shell here. 
      - It is a fully programmable JavaScript environment.


.. include:: /includes/np.rst

Exploring Collections
---------------------


.. code-block:: bash

   show collections

   db.collection.help()

   db.collection.find()

.. include:: /includes/student-notes.rst

.. only:: instructor

   .. note::

      - Show the collections available in this database.
      - Show methods on the collection with parameters and a brief explanation.
      - Finally, we can query for the documents in a collection.


Admin Commands
--------------

- There are also a number of admin commands at our disposal. 
- The following will shut down the mongod we are connected to through the Mongo shell. 
- You can also just kill with Ctrl-C in the shell window from which you launched the mongod.

  .. code-block:: bash

     db.adminCommand( { shutdown : 1 } )

- Confirm that the mongod process has indeed stopped. 
- Once you have, please restart it.

The MongoDB Data Directory
--------------------------


.. code-block:: bash

   ls /data/db

- The mongod.lock file

  - This prevents multiple mongods from using the same data directory simultaneously.
  - Each MongoDB database directory has one .lock. 
  - The lock file contains the process id of the mongod that is using the directory. 
- Data files

  - The names of the files correspond to available databases.
  - A single database may have multiple files.

.. include:: /includes/student-notes.rst

.. only:: instructor

   .. note::

      Files for a single database increase in size as follows:

      - sample.0 is 64 MB
      - sample.1 is 128 MB
      - sample.2 is 256 MB, etc. 
      - This continues until sample.5, which is 2 GB
      - All subsequent data files are also 2 GB.
