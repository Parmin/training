Lab: Data Model for an E-Commerce Site
======================================

Introduction
------------

- In this group exercise, we're going to take what we've learned about MongoDB and develop a basic but reasonable data model for an e-commerce site.
- For users of RDBMSs, the most challenging part of the exercise will be figuring out how to construct a data model when joins aren't allowed.
- We're going to model for several entities and features.


Product Catalog
---------------

- **Products.** Products vary quite a bit. In addition to the standard production attributes, we will allow for variations of product type and custom attributes. E.g., users may search for blue jackets, 11-inch macbooks, or size 12 shoes. The product catalog will contain millions of products.
- **Product pricing.** Current prices as well as price histories.
- **Product categories.** Every e-commerce site includes a category hierarchy. We need to allow for both that hierarchy and the many-to-many relationship between products and categories.
- **Product reviews.** Every product has zero or more reviews and each review can receive votes and comments.

   .. note::

      - The most difficult part to this exercise is querying on arbitrary attributes, e.g. macbooks with 11 inch screens.  Something like "tags" : [ { "key" : "screen_size", "value" : 11}, { "key" : "brand", "value" : "Apple" } ] can be used, but $elemMatch is extremely important here!
      - Representing the category hierarchy is also interesting

Product Metrics
---------------

- **Product views and purchases.** Keep track of the number of times each product is viewed and when each product is purchased.
- **Top 10 lists.** Create queries for top 10 viewed products, top 10 purchased products.
- **Graph historical trends.** Create a query to graph how a product is viewed/purchased over the past.
- **30 days with 1 hour granularity.** This graph will appear on every product page, the query must be very fast.

   .. note::

      - Use arrays here (for hour/day granularity), and aggregate the arrays for other reports

Deliverables
------------

- Sample document and schema for each collection
- Queries the application will use
- Index definitions

Break into groups of two or three and work together to create these deliverables.
