Exercise #1

Navigate the MMS interface to perform the following:

- Generate an API key
- Add your personal machine to the API whitelist

.. include:: /includes/student-notes.rst

.. only:: instructor

   .. note::

      - Admin -> API Keys and Whitelists
  
Exercise #2
-----------

Modify and run the following curl command to return alerts for your MMS group:

.. code-block:: javascript

	curl -u "username:apiKey" --digest -i 
	"https://mms.mongodb.com/api/public/v1.0/groups/<GROUP-ID>/alerts"

.. include:: /includes/student-notes.rst

.. only:: instructor

   .. note::

      - Make sure the group id matches a group within the student's account
      - Ensure the IP address the request was coming from is whitelisted
      - Ensure the username/apiKey is correct


Exercise #3
-----------

How would you find metrics for a given host within your MMS account?  Create an outline for the API calls needed.

.. include:: /includes/student-notes.rst

.. only:: instructor

   .. note::

      - First, query the API for a list of hosts: https://docs.mms.mongodb.com/reference/api/hosts/
      - Next, query the metrics API call with the host is and name of the metric (or for all metrics): https://docs.mms.mongodb.com/reference/api/hosts/
