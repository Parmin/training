.. include:: /includes/student-notes.rst


Exercise #1
-----------

Create a cluster using Cloud Manager automation with the following topology:

- 3 shards
- Each shard is a 3 node replica set (2 data bearing nodes, 1 arbiter)
- Version 2.6.8 of MongoDB
- **To conserve space, set "smallfiles" = true and "oplogSize" = 10**

   .. note::

      - Windows is not supported, Windows users should work with another person in the class or work on a remote Linux machine
      - The entire cluster should be deployed on a single server (or the students laptop)
      - Registration is free, and won't require a credit card as long as the student stays below 8 servers


Exercise #2
-----------

Modify the cluster topology from Exercise #1 to the following:

- 4 shards (add one shard)
- Version 3.0.1 of MongoDB (upgrade from 2.6.8 -> 3.0.1)

   .. note::

      - Students may complete this in one or two steps
      - Cluster configuration should be modified, then redeployed
