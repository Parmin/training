Lab: Cloud Manager Point-in-Time Backup
=======================================



Exercise: Point-in-Time Backup
------------------------------

Premise: "*I thought I was on my development machine and I've accidentally dropped a collection in production.*"

Your data is backed up in Cloud Manager, so you can recover all the data that existed immediately before the drop. You'll need to request a point-in-time backup and then restore it.

The collection is ``test.users`` and the total number of documents
prior to the drop was 20,000.

*Note: The instructor will provide instructions for ssh into Amazon EC2 for this exercise.*
