Lab: Ops Manager Point-in-Time Backup
=====================================



Exercise: Point-in-Time Backup
------------------------------

Premise:
"*Suppose someone introduced an incorrect code path that randomly drops the database from our production environment.*"

Your data is backed up in Ops Manager, so you can recover all the data that
existed immediately before the drop. You'll need to request a point-in-time
backup and then restore it.

The collection is ``injector.data`` and the total number of documents,
regardless of the drop, should be 20,000.

.. only:: instructor

  .. note::

    In the ``/shared/`` folder students can find a script called ``inject20k``.
    This is an executable that will insert 20K documents and will drop the
    database at a random point in time.

    Students will have to:
    - Determine the which data was lost
    - Request a PITR from Ops Manager
    - Reinsert any data post drop

    Ask the students to set up a 3 node replica set with the following config:

    - **Replica Set Name** : DROP_OUT
    - **node1** : Priority 10
    - **node2** : Priority 3
    - **node3** : Priority 0

    The replica set should be set up using the Ops Manager UI.
