=============================================
Lab: Data Model for an Internet of Things App
=============================================

Introduction
------------

- Consier a an internet-connected pill bottle.
- It will:

  - Weigh its contents.
  - Track how many pills it contains.
  - Notify the user if they are late in taking a pill.

.. include:: /includes/student-notes.rst


Pill Bottle Information
-----------------------

- **pill** - the type of pill contained in the bottle.
- **mass** - the mass of the bottle's contents
- **mass per pill** - the mass of one of the pills contained in the bottle
- **number of pills**  - the number of pills in the bottle
- **Events** - When the bottle is opened or closed, how many pills
  added/removed
- **Heartbeat** - registering that the pill bottle is connected to wi-fi

.. include:: /includes/student-notes.rst


Pill Bottle Operations
----------------------

Each pill bottle will perform the following queries:

.. rst-class:: longlist

- A query to find the user it's associated with, plus the medication and
  dosage.

  - Frequency: very rarely; assume it would change 1/year.
  - Information: username, medication ID, medication mass per pill, frequency
    of dosage

- An operation to store information on the weight of its contents, and to act
  as a heartbeat.

  - Frequency: once every 10 minutes


Pill Bottle Operations (con't)
------------------------------

- An operation to log the time, the mass, the estimated number of pills in
  the bottle, and the number of pills taken while the botle was opened.

  - Frequency: 1-6 times per bottle per day (assume an average of 3)


Other Application Operations
----------------------------

There will also be a web and notification server which will do the following:

- Query 1/hour to determine:

  - Which customers are more than an hour late in taking their pill.
  - Which pill bottles have not called in for a heartbeat for an hour.

- Query when user logs in to a web site to generate a calendar showing on which
  days they take their pills and which days they miss one or more

  - Assume an average of 1/week

.. include:: /includes/student-notes.rst


Other Application Operations (cont'd)
-------------------------------------

- Store user contact information, bottle information, etc. when an account is
  created

  - Insert 1/year

.. include:: /includes/student-notes.rst

.. only:: instructor

  .. note::

    - If one of the students asks if it's even necessary to optimize this
      application, remind them that any product will face two possible paths
      down the line: it will scale, or it will fail.

      - If demand never picks up, the product will be dropped, and nothing will
        matter.
      - If demand does pick up, they'll want the system to work as efficiently
        as possible to minimize cost & hassle for any given load.


Deliverables
------------

Break into groups of two or three and work together to create the following
deliverables:

- Assumptions about sizing

  - number of documents per collection
  - frequency of requests

- Sample documents for each collection you're creating
- Queries the application will use
- Index creation commands
- Should you shard some collections? Now? Later?

.. include:: /includes/student-notes.rst


Solution - Sizing
-----------------

- 100M customers in the first 3 years (up to 1B later)
- average of 3 bottles per customer
- operations:

  - 3 * 100M / 600 sec = 5M heartbeats per second

- data size:

  - 300M bottles * 100 bytes = 30GB
  - 100M customers * 1000 bytes = 100GB

.. include:: /includes/student-notes.rst

Solution - Collections
----------------------

- users

  - Contact Information
  - Bottles they're linked to, and medication associated with each bottle
  - Medications they take

    - Frequency of medication

.. include:: /includes/student-notes.rst

Solution - Collections (con't)
------------------------------


- bottles

  - Medication associated with the bottle
  - Mass of contents
  - Estimated number of pills
  - Timestamp of measurement
  - Action: heartbeat, bottle opened, or bottle closed
  - If bottle closed, number of pills added/removed

.. include:: /includes/student-notes.rst

Solution - Collections (con't)
------------------------------

- medications

  - Link to an image of the medication
  - Type of medication (pill, capsule, or liquid)
  - Information on the medication (string)

- notifications

  - Timestamp
  - Type (SMS, email)
  - Message
  - To

.. include:: /includes/student-notes.rst

Solution - Considerations
-------------------------

- There will be duplication of information between the ``Medications``
  collection and the ``Users`` collection.
- Capturing the "heartbeat" will be the most common operation,
  and we should optimize for that.
- Are there any health data regulation that requires us to keep the
  last X heartbeats or actions from a user for a period of time?

  db.bottles.find(
    { user_id : "username", action : "bottle closed" },
    { bottle_id : 1, time : 1, pills_taken : 1 }
  ).sort( { bottle_id : 1, time : 1 } )

.. code-block:: javascript

  db.bottles.find(
  { bottle_id : ObjectId(...),
    time : { $gte : ISODate(...), $lte : ISODate(...) } },
  { time : 1, action : 1, pills_taken : 1 }
  ).sort( { time : 1 } )

  db.notifications.insertOne(

      _id : ObjectId(...),
      user_id : ObjectId(...),

      target : "(555) 555-5555",
      message : "You missed a dose of Cordrazine this morning..."
    } )

.. include:: /includes/student-notes.rst


Indexes
-------

.. code-block:: javascript

  db.bottles.createIndex(
  { user_id : 1, action : 1, bottle_id : 1, time : 1, pills_taken : 1 },
  { partialFilterExpression : { action : "bottle closed" } }
  ) // Allows for a covered query when finding pills taken (or not).

  db.bottles.createIndex( { bottle_id : 1, time : 1, action : 1, pills_taken : 1 } )
  // The _id index is sufficient to limit us to just one document for the user queries

.. include:: /includes/student-notes.rst


Sharding
--------

From a data point of view:

- not needed for: userdata, medications
- needed to keep heartbeats over a long period of time

From an operation point of view:

- 5M writes per seconds is a lot for a simple replica set.
  Either shard, or reduce the number of writes

.. include:: /includes/student-notes.rst


Good shard key
--------------

A) { user_id: 1,  bottle_id }

B) { bottle_id: 1 }

.. include:: /includes/student-notes.rst


[DC] summary of issues we need to fix
-------------------------------------

- where do we put the heartbeat
- 5M writes per seconds is a lot

  - be careful about the number of indexes associated with the heartbeat

- detail the ratio of reads/writes per collection
