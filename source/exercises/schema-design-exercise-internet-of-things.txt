Lab: Data Model for an Internet of Things App
=============================================

Introduction
------------

- In this group exercise, we're going to take what we've learned about MongoDB
  and develop a basic but reasonable data model for an "internet of things"
  app.
- The **thing** will be a pill bottle, which will weigh its contents and keep
  track of how many pills it contains.
- This is useful for medical patients, as forgetting to take a pill is a common
  problem. The bottle will light up and the user will get a text message if
  they are late in taking a pill.
