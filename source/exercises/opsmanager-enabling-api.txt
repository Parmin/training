Lab: Enable the Ops Manager Public API
======================================


Learning Objectives
-------------------

Upon completing this lab, students will be able to:

* Understand the requirements for enabling Ops Manager Public API

Exercise: Enable Public API Access
----------------------------------

Ops Manager, for most users, is primarily controlled via it's web UI, but it
has an API that supports most of the operations that users perform.

Enable your deployment of Ops Manager to allow API calls.

- Generate an API Key called "generic"

To verify that you've done this properly you can make the following request:

.. rst-class:: longcode

  .. code-block:: sh

    curl -u "$EMAIL:$APIKEY" --digest \
      -i "$OPSMGRURL/api/public/v1.0/groups"

.. only:: instructor

  .. note::

    Enabling the Public API on Ops Manager enables it across all groups.
    Previously, the API had to be enabled on a group by group basis.
