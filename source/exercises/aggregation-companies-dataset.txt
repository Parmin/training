Exercise: Importing the "companies" dataset
--------------------------------------------

`Handout Link <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thatnerd/work-public/master/mongodb_trainings/companies.zip>`_

Download the handout and unpack.

Next, do the following:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ mongoimport -d training -c companies --drop companies.json

You now have a dataset of companies on your server.

.. include:: /includes/student-notes.rst



The Companies Dataset: Fields of Interest
-----------------------------------------

Here are some interesting fields in the data set:

.. code-block:: javascript

  > db.companies.find( { }, { name : 1, number_of_employees: 1, _id: 0, founded_year: 1, deadpooled_year: 1, total_money_raised: 1 } )

Additional fields of potential interest:

-  "tag_list", "alias_list", "description", "overview", "products", "relationships", "competitions", "providerships", "total_money_raised", "funding_rounds", "investments", "acquisition", "acquisitions", "offices", "milestones",  "partners"

.. include:: /includes/student-notes.rst



The Companies Dataset: Next Steps
---------------------------------

- At this point, you've got the companies dataset.
- Take a look at the following fields. What do you notice about them?

  - tag_list
  - providerships
  - products


.. include:: /includes/student-notes.rst

.. only:: instructor

  .. note::

    - The tag list is a comma-separated string, not an array

      - Some fields are the empty string ("")
      - Some fields are null

    - providerships and products are either empty arrays, or an array of subdocuments
