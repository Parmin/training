Lab: Descriptive Statistics
---------------------------

From the ``grades`` collection, find the class (display the ``class_id``) with the best average student performance.

If you have not already done so, import the grades collection as follows.

.. code-block:: bash

   mongoimport -d test -c grades --drop grades.json

Before you attempt this exercise, explore the ``grades`` collection a little to ensure you understand how it is structured.

For additional exercises, consider other statistics you might want to see with this data and how to calculate them.
