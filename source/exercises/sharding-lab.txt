============
Sharding Lab
============

.. only:: instructor

   .. warning:: PLACEHOLDER

      - We need to build a lab with multiple parts that will enable instructors to select components as they have time.
      - We should also have students:

        - Pre-split and import some data.
        - Create a shard key and shard one or more collections
        - We should set up several queries that students can run .explain() on to view how the query was distributed: some targeted, some scatter/gather.  
        - It might be of advantage to have them add a shard, see how the data is balanced, and then run the queries again to see how the "application layer" didn't change but the query is now routed differently.  
        - Then have them knock that new server down and run the query again and see how it fails.  
      - Maybe drain a shard?
