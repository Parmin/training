Taking the Exam: an Overview
----------------------------

You'll take the exam at home, at your computer. You'll need to be alone, and you'll need the area to be clean and devoid of study materials. When you take the exam, there will be a live proctor from Examity, and he or she will take you through the steps, help you begin your test, and will let you know if anything is out of order, so you don't violate exam rules without knowing it.

Taking the Exam: Your Computer
------------------------------

Your computer must be a Windows or Mac machine (Sorry, no Linux machines yet!), and it must have a video camera (webcam), a microphone, and speakers. The webcam can be built-in, or it can be a peripheral, but you need to be able to position it so that the proctor can see your face throughout the exam, and you must be able to pivot it (possibly by picking up your laptop) so that the proctor can see everything in the room, including your desk. You can't use headphones, and need to use speakers so that you can hear the proctor.

Before you even schedule the exam, be sure to use the `Exam Readiness Check`. This will tell you if there are any issues with your webcam, your internet connection, your microphone, etc. If you're going to have problems, it's best to find out early.


Taking the Exam: Your Exam Space
--------------------------------

You need to be alone when taking the exam. No-one is permitted to be with you, and your area needs to be private: a room where you can be alone. You can't have any reference materials present, and your area must be free of clutter (this will be verified by the proctor before the exam begins). You can take the exam at any point during a one-week interval, day or night. This interval typically begins and ends at 5 PM UTC on a Tuesday (12:00 or 1:00 PM New York time, depending on when in the year it takes place), but be sure to check on the about page for `the DBA exam <https://university.mongodb.com/exams/C100DBA/about>`_ or `the Dev exam <https://university.mongodb.com/exams/C100DEV/about>`_.


Taking the Exam: Scoring and Test-Taking Strategies
---------------------------------------------------

The exam currently has two types of problem: Multiple Choice, and Check All that Apply. Most questions (of average difficulty) will have 5 choices for Multiple Choice, or 3 for Check All that Apply. 

There is no penalty for guessing, so you should have an answer for every problem. If you find that you are getting close to running out of time, be sure to run through & provide an answer for each question. Leaving them blank will guarantee that you don't get credit.

Taking the Exam: Translation Software
-------------------------------------

This is worth mentioning, because it's the only reference material permitted during the exam: you can use a translation software in order to translate the questions from english to another language, using your web browser. We don't support any particular translation software, nor can we at MongoDB vouch for the accuracy of the translation of any particular software, but you are welcome to use it on your own, during the test, if you are willing to assume any risks associated with the software.
