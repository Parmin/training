Introduction
------------

This section will describe the knowledge upon which most other MongoDB knowledge is built

This section will cover concepts that you should understand before taking the exam, but which will not be explicitly covered by the exam (though you may find some questions that implicitly expect you to know this information).


Fundamental Database Concepts
-----------------------------

It is expected that you will understand the basics of the database industry:

- What constitutes a relational (or a non-relational) database. 
- How joins and transactions work in a conceptual way

Resources:

- From mongodb.com:

  - `NoSQL Database Explained <https://www.mongodb.com/nosql-explained>`_


Fundamentals of System Programming
----------------------------------

For the exam, you should be able to define:

- Physical Memoary
- Virtual Memory
- Memory Mapping
- Hex (base-16) Representations of Data

You can find resources around the web to help you with this.


Basics of Javascript Programming
--------------------------------

For the exam, you should know:

- How to assign values to variables
- How to write a "for" or "while" loop
- How to print data
- How to list available databases/collections in the mongo shell
- How to switch to a database context

Here are some basic exercises in the Mongo shell:

To assign a value to a variable, you use the '=' sign. Let's assign the value of 5 to the 'x' variable:

.. code-block:: javascript
  
  > var x = 5;
  > print(x)
  5

The variable assignment can also be done implicitly, and the semicolons are often optional, so this can also work:

.. code-block:: javascript
  
  > x = 5
  5
  > print(x)
  5

There are some objects and functions provided that you can use for some common use cases:

.. code-block:: javascript

  > Math.floor(3.5)
  3
  > Math.PI
  3.141592653589793
  > ISODate()
  ISODate("2015-07-22T19:04:34.219Z")
  > print("hello")
  hello
  >

You can also create loops using the shell:

.. code-block:: javascript

  > var x = 0
  > while ( x < 5 ) { x++; print(x) }
  1
  2
  3
  4
  5
  > for (i=0; i<=3; i++) { print(i) }
  0
  1
  2
  3
  > x = { a : 4, b : 3, c : 2 }
  { "a" : 4, "b" : 3, "c" : 2 }
  > for (key in x) { print(key + ': ' + x[key]) }
  a: 4
  b: 3
  c: 2
  >

In MongoDB, you will often be working with database or collection objects:

.. code-block:: javascript

  > db
  test
  > db.currentOP()
  { "inprog" : [ ] }
  > db.people.find()
  { "_id" : ObjectId("55afeb6a6daadd6baf25c63b"), "name" : "Dwight", "title" : "Chair of the Board" }
  { "_id" : ObjectId("55afeb7b6daadd6baf25c63c"), "name" : "Andrew", "title" : "VP of Developer Experience" }
       
Exercises to Complete
---------------------

- Write a for loop that inserts one million documents in the mongo shell.
- Create a collection with a field that contains the _id of documents in another collection.

  - Use the _id reference to manually "join" the two collections.
