Sharding
========

On the certification exam, we will attempt to verify that you:

- Know the benefits of sharding
- Know how to construct a good shard key, and what can go wrong with selecting a shard key
- Understand the balancer
- Know the role of the config servers and how they work.

Sharding Subtopics

Introduction
------------

Sharding is about scaling. With sharding, you can distribute your data across several replica sets, each of which is a logical "node" in the sharded cluster.

Note that sharding is largely orthogonal to Replication, which is about data durability and availability.

Exercises
---------

Try to perform the following on your own:

- Spin up a sharded cluster
- Add a shard
- Shard a collection in the cluster.
- Add data to a chunk, and watch as it:

  - Splits
  - Migrates elsewhere (if enough chunks are split)

- View the status of your cluster in the "config" database.
- Manually split a chunk.
- Drain a shard and remove it from the cluster.
