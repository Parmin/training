========
Sharding
========

On the certification exam, we will verify that you:

- Understand horizontal scaling and how sharding provides this capability in MongoDB
- Know how to construct a good shard key, and what can go wrong with selecting a shard key
- Understand the balancer
- Know the role of the config servers and how they work.


Introduction
------------

Sharding is about scaling. With sharding, you can distribute your data across several replica sets, each of which is a logical "node" in the sharded cluster.

Note that sharding and replication solve different problems. Replication is concerned with data durability and high availability.

Primary Shard
-------------

For the exam, you should know:

Exercises
---------

Try to perform the following on your own:

- Spin up a sharded cluster
- Add a shard
- Shard a collection in the cluster.
- Add data to a chunk, and watch as it:

  - Splits
  - Migrates elsewhere (if enough chunks are split)

- View the status of your cluster in the "config" database.
- Manually split a chunk.
- Drain a shard and remove it from the cluster.
