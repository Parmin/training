Application and Server Administration (DBA Only)
================================================

For the Certification Exam, students will be expected to:

- Be able to evaluate options about basic server diagnostics, maintenance, backup, and disaster recovery.


Application and Server Administration Topics
--------------------------------------------

- Journal
- Server Logs
- The Profiler
- MongoDB Security

  - MongoDB CR

    - User roles

  - Security Features Available

- Cluster Architecture
- Diagnostics and Debugging
- Maintenance
- Backup
- Recovery


Introduction
------------

While the definitions are somewhat fluid, Application Administration deals with MongoDB's relationship to applications. Since MongoDB is a flexible data store, it's basically never used alone, except for training purposes. It's always hooked into an application, and this requires a certain set of features to assist with the interface, such as the wire protocol, over-the-wire encryption, and security. 

Server administration deals with all other aspects of architecting, maintaining, or repairing the server system. While Sharding and Replication are big enough to merit their own sections in the exam, this should cover almost everything else.


Journal
-------

For the exam, you will be expected to:

- Know the purpose of the journal
- Understand that it's implemented as a binary write-ahead log
- Understand why it ensures consistent data in the event of server failure for MMAPv1
- Understand why it is unnecessary for WiredTiger
- Understand how long writes can take to get to disk with and without the journal for MMAPv1 and WiredTiger

Diagnostics and Debugging
-------------------------

For the exam, you should know:

- How to interpret those commands
- Solutions to simple problems that may arise, such as:

  - A server is down
  - A config server is down
  - A long-running query is grabbing too many resources
  - All queries are confined to one server in a sharded cluster

Further Exercises
-----------------

- Create a replica set or sharded cluster. Create a database, and then drop it. Put the server under a simulated load, and then insert an array of large documents (~15 MB), preferably as a bulk insert. Check the server logs and try to find the long-running events.
- Run a mongod with --auth. Log in, and create a User Admin, and use that login to create a user with Read permissions in one database and ReadWrite permissions in another. Verify that you are able to login and read/write as appropriate, and are locked out of other databases.
- Backup your data with a filesystem snapshot. Drop your database, and restore from the backup. Repeat for mongodump/mongorestore.
- Turn on the profiler to level 2, and then perform some read queries, and some write queries. Find out how long they took. Don't forget to set the profiler back to level 0.
- Turn on the profiler to level 1, and try to create some long-running queries that get captured.
- Start a long-running process, then use db.currentOp() and db.killOp() to find and kill it.
