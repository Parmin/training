=======================
Philosophy and Features
=======================

On the certification exam, we will attempt to verify that you:

- Know and can define the basic features of MongoDB 
- Understand JSON and BSON at a basic level


Subtopics
---------

- Introduction
- JSON
- BSON
- The Mongo Shell
- Horizontal Scaling
- MongoDB and Relational DB's
- MongoDB as a "schemaless" database


Introduction
------------

Here is a `white paper that touches on multiple topics <https://www.mongodb.com/json-and-bson>`_.


JSON
----

For the exam, you should know:

- All JSON types
- The structure of JSON objects and arrays
- How to nest data into JSON objects and arrays
- How to read JSON

Here are some good resources:

- Videos:

  - `Introduction to JSON <https://university.mongodb.com/videos/y/PTATjNSjbJ0>`_
  - `JSON revisited <https://university.mongodb.com/videos/y/CTffxoSSLqg>`_
  - `JSON subdocuments <https://university.mongodb.com/videos/y/vrYAEH3g13M>`_
  - `JSON spec <https://university.mongodb.com/videos/y/kOrsT94-A28>`_

- Other MongoDB Links

  - `Document databases <https://www.mongodb.com/document-databases>`_

- Docs:

  - :manual:`Intro to JSON</reference/mongodb-extended-json/>`

- External links:

  - `json.org <http://json.org/>`_


BSON
----

For the exam, you should know:

- How BSON relates to JSON

  - That BSON is an open source binary JSON format

- That MongoDB can read and "reach into" the structure of BSON
- That BSON includes explicity type info as well as byte length of values

Resources:

- Web docs:

  - `BSON spec <http://bsonspec.org/>`_

- MongoDB Docs:

  - :manual:`BSONdump</reference/program/bsondump/>`
   
    - you can point it at MongoDB data files if you're using MMAPv1 to see what they contain.


The Mongo Shell
---------------

For the exam, you should know:

- Why we use the shell (administration, teaching)
- How to write basic routines (for loops & similar)

- Video:

  - `Lesson video <https://university.mongodb.com/videos/y/e18vCIdQKp4>`_

- Docs:

  - :manual:`Getting Started with the mongo Shell</tutorial/getting-started-with-the-mongo-shell/>`
  - :manual:`mongo Shell Quick Reference</reference/mongo-shell/>`

You should also know the :manual:`types in the shell</core/shell-types/>`.


Vertical and Horizontal Scaling
-------------------------------

For the exam, you should know:

- What is meant by vertical and horizontal scaling
- What MongoDB's approach to horizontal scaling is called

Resources:

- Webinar:

  - `Scaling MongoDB Webinar Series <https://www.mongodb.com/lp/webinar/scaling-series-sept-2014>`_

- Docs:

  - :manual:`Sharding Introduction</core/sharding-introduction/>`



MongoDB and Relational DB's
---------------------------

For the exam, you should know:

- What relational database features MongoDB foregoes in order to be scalable
- How the relational data structures differ from MongoDB

Resources:

- Video:

  - `MongoDB and Relational DB's <https://university.mongodb.com/videos/y/-KIC1LXxcGM>`_

- Docs:

  - :manual:`SQL to MongoDB Mapping Chart</reference/sql-comparison/>`

- MongoDB.com:

  - `Compare MongoDB and MySQL <https://www.mongodb.com/compare/mongodb-mysql>`_


MongoDB as a "Schemaless" Database
----------------------------------

For the exam, you should know:

- Why MongoDB is called a "schemaless" database
- How this different from relational databases
- The atomicity of write operations in MongoDB

Resources:

- Video:

  - `MongoDB is Schemaless <https://university.mongodb.com/videos/y/uKB-Hoqs6zI>`_

- Docs:

  - `Data Modeling Introduction <http://docs.mongodb.org/master/core/data-modeling-introduction/>`_


Sample Problems
---------------

1. Which features of relational database management systems were deliberately omitted in MongoDB and help us to obtain horizontal scalability? Check all that apply.

a. Multi-statement transactions
b. Authentication
c. Joins

2. In order to ensure that you can maintain high availability in the face of server failure, you should implement which of the following?

a. Replication
b. Sharding
c. The proper storage engine
d. Properly defined user roles
e. Put indexes on all of your documents

3. What are the uses of the mongo shell? Check all that apply.

a. Introduce people to MongoDB with a simple interface.
b. Perform administrative tasks.
c. Use as a javascript framework for your production system.

Answers to Sample Problems
--------------------------

1. a, c
2. a
3. a, b

Exercises
---------

- Read a MongoDB white paper
- Write a simple routine in javascript
