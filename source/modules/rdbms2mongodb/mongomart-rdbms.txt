What is MongoMart
-----------------

MongoMart is an on-line store for buying MongoDB merchandise.
In this workshop we will start with a RDBMS version and end up with a MongoDB
one.

      - Mongomart is in the training repo in the training portal, packaged has mongomart.zip .
      - Ask the students to login and download it.
      - In case they are not able to login, have a spare pen drive that you can pass along the classroom.
      - You should also have an instructor only mongomart-instructor.zip file in the training portal.
      - This will include the solutions for the different exercises.
      - Ensure you've loaded the dataset from /mongomart/dataset as described in the /mongomart/rdbms/README file)
      - DO NOT WALK THROUGH THIS VERSION OF THE SOURCE CODE WITH THE STUDENTS, ONLY THE STUDENT VERSION

Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)
---------------------------------

.. include:: /images/mongomart-erd.rst

.. include:: /includes/student-notes.rst

.. only:: instructor

   .. note::

     This is the mongomart rdbms relational model diagram.
     Take a few moments to walk them through the model.
     The next sections have a more detailed view.

     Important to bring up that we have 2 clear model components in this app,
     that can be treated in parallel.

     This is an important aspect of the migration process, understand the model
     that we are working with, and make decisions on how to approach the
     migration process.


Stores ERD
----------

.. include:: /images/mongomart-stores-erd.rst

.. include:: /includes/student-notes.rst

.. only:: instructor

  .. note::

    In this diagram, bring students attention to the following:

    - This a pretty straight forward approach
    - A store can have multiple addresses, and multiple geo locations (which is wrong on purpose!)
    - Stores can be found either by their address or by their geo location.


Items ERD
---------

.. include:: /images/mongomart-items-erd.rst

.. include:: /includes/student-notes.rst

.. only:: instructor

   .. note::

     In this diagram, bring students attention to the following:

     - An item has categories and a category can be referenced by several
       different items
     - A cart will have several items and an item can be included in several
       different carts

        - Apart from that, the join/junction table will also account for the
          cart item quantity.

     - Then we have items with reviews. Each review corresponds only to one item
       , but an item can have multiple reviews.

     Our migration will start with this component of the application.
