What is MongoMart
-----------------

MongoMart is an on-line store for buying MongoDB merchandise.

In this workshop, we will start with MongoMart backed by an RDBMS, and end with
MongoDB in the backend.

MongoMart: Demo of the RDBMS Version
------------------------------------

- View Items
- View Items by Category
- Text Search
- View Item Details
- Shopping Cart

.. include:: /includes/student-notes.rst

.. only:: instructor

   .. note::

      - Mongomart is in the training repo in the training portal, packaged into
        the file ``rdbms2mongodb.zip`` .
      - Ask the students to log in to the portal and download it.
      - In case they are unable to log in to the portal, have a spare USB drive
        that you can pass along the classroom.
      - The students will have the solutions, but discourage them from applying
        those solutions before they have had a chance to do it for themselves.

        - Obviously, we can't stop them, but it should be easy enough to tell
          them to hold off on anything in the ``solutions`` directory until
          each exercise is finished.


View Items
----------

- Go to http://localhost:8080
- This is MongoMart
- Notice: 

  - There are a set of product categories
  - Each category has a set of products
  - The number of products in each category is listed

- Click on Apparel

.. include:: /includes/student-notes.rst

.. only:: instructor

   .. note::

      - Click around the site to show them how it works, click through various pages and categories (into next slide)


View Items by Category
----------------------

- The url is http://localhost:8080/?category=Apparel
- Note that "All" is listed as a category 

  - Use that to return to view all items

.. include:: /includes/student-notes.rst


Text Search
-----------

- Notice the search bar at the top.

  - Input `shirt` and click `Submit`
  - The url will be http://localhost:8080/search?query=shirt
  - You'll get a `404` error. This is expected.

- The text search functionality is not yet implemented.
- We will add add it as part of this workshop.

.. include:: /includes/student-notes.rst

.. only:: instructor

   .. note::

      - Once we move the application to be supported by MongoDB we will enable
        text search
      - Search for a few strings, such as "shirt", "mug", "mongodb", etc.


View Item Details
-----------------

- Go back and click on the Gray Hooded Sweatshirt

  - http://localhost:8080/item?id=1

- Notice that there is a star rating based on reviews
- Add a review
- Add item to cart

.. include:: /includes/student-notes.rst

.. only:: instructor

   .. note::

      - Add reviews, show how stars change, etc.
      - Currently, the aggregate star rating does not reset as you add reviews.

        - If anyone notices this, it is a known issue.

      - If they click on "Proceed to Checkout," that functionality won't work either. 

        - This is another known issue.


Shopping Cart
-------------

- You are now at http://localhost:8080/cart
- Quantity is chosen here, and the cart updates when quantity is changed.
- Changing quantity to 0 removes item

.. include:: /includes/student-notes.rst

.. only:: instructor

   .. note::

      - Add an item to your cart
      - Update the quantity in the cart
      - Checkout doesn't work, we are only interested in the cart functionality


Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)
---------------------------------

.. include:: /images/mongomart-erd.rst

.. include:: /includes/student-notes.rst

.. only:: instructor

   .. note::

     Explain to the students that this is the mongomart rdbms relational model
     diagram. Take a few moments to walk them through the model. The next
     sections have a more detailed view.

     Important to bring up that we have 2 clear model components in this app,
     that operate in parallel.

     This is an important aspect of the migration process. Understand the model
     that we are working with, and make decisions on how to approach the
     migration process.


Stores ERD
----------

.. include:: /images/mongomart-stores-erd.rst

.. include:: /includes/student-notes.rst

.. only:: instructor

  .. note::

    In this diagram, bring students' attention to the following:

    - This a pretty linear approach
    - A store can have multiple addresses, and multiple geo locations. This is wrong on purpose!!
    - Stores can be found either by their address, or by their geo location.


Items ERD
---------

.. include:: /images/mongomart-items-erd.rst

.. include:: /includes/student-notes.rst

.. only:: instructor

   .. note::

     In this diagram, bring students attention to the following:

     - An item has categories, and a category can be referenced by several
       different items
     - A cart will have several items, and an item can be included in several
       different carts

        - Apart from that, the ``join/junction`` table will also account for the
          cart item quantity.

     - Then we have items with reviews. Each review corresponds only to one
       item, but an item can have multiple reviews.

     Our migration will start with this component of the application.
