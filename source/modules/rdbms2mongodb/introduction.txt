=============================
RDBMS to MongoDB Introduction
=============================

Welcome
-------

This is a single-day workshop where we will cover the following:

- Migrating from an RDBMS to MongoDB, including:

  - Migration strategies
  - Architecture and application implications
  - Relation to Document modeling
  - MongoDB CRUD operations

.. include:: /includes/student-notes.rst

Where do we start?
------------------

You will be given a fully functional application called **Mongomart** backed by
a relational database.

You will perform a set of tasks to move this application to a MongoDB-supported
back end.

After each task, the instructor will provide a solution. This will ensure that
everyone is working from the same starting point for each task.

.. only:: instructor

  .. note::

    Tell the students that they **should*** be given enough time to complete
    the tasks on their own. However, to keep everyone on the same page, we will be
    sharing incremental solutions to the different purposed labs.

Requirements
------------

We need to understand:

- What the relation schema looks like *(ERD)*
- How we will store the **same** information in MongoDB

.. only:: instructor

  .. note::

    Bring students attention to:

    - different strategies might end up with different schemas
    - the strategy we use in this workshop might not apply to other scenarios
    - this is an exercise that does not take into consideration actual
      production load. This is something that should not be neglected in
      production environments.

Learning Objectives
-------------------

By the end of this workshop, you will be able to:

- Perform all steps required to move a relational system to MongoDB
- Evaluate the benefits and tradeoffs of the different migration approaches
- Implement relational to document mapping
