=============================
RDBMS to MongoDB Introduction
=============================

Welcome
-------

This is a full day workshop where we are going to be covering the following
topics:

- Migration strategies
- Architecture and application implications
- Relation to Document modeling
- MongoDB CRUD operations

Where do we start?
------------------

You will be given a fully functional application called **Mongomart** backed by
a relational database.

You will be tasked with defining the different tasks required to move this
application to a MongoDB supported backend.

After each task the instructor will provide a solution for each of the
labs/tasks.

.. only:: instructor

  .. note::

    Note to students that they will be given enough time to complete the tasks
    on their own, however, to avoid leaving people behind we will be sharing
    incremental solutions to the different purposed labs.

How are we going to do that?
----------------------------

Given a migration strategy, defined by the instructor, we will migrating our
application.

We need to understand:

- What's the relation schema looks like. *(ERD)*
- How do we want to store the same information in a MongoDB document model.

.. only:: instructor

  .. note::

    Bring students attention to:

    - different strategies might end up with different schemas
    - the followed strategy might not apply to their real life scenarios
    - this is an exercise that does not take into consideration actual
      production level load. Something that should not be neglected in
      production environments .

What to expect by the end of the workshop?
------------------------------------------

By the end of this workshop you will be more suited to:

- Understand the practical tasks required to move a relational system to MongoDB
- The benefits and tradeoffs of the different migration approaches
- Considerations about schema design and relational to document mapping
