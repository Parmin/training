Environment Setup

Setup Workshop Environment
--------------------------

After downloading the workshop material, it is time to bring **MongoMart** up
on your local machine.

In the next few slides, we will do the following:

- Unzip the ``rdbms2mongodb.zip`` file
- Launch a MySQL server instance locally
- Import the dataset
- Run the ``mongomart`` web server locally, backed by the RDBMS

.. include:: /includes/student-notes.rst


Unzip ``rdbms2mongodb.zip``
---------------------------

Unpack the ``rdbms2mongodb.zip`` file.

.. code-block:: sh

  unzip rdbms2mongodb.zip

In it, you will find the following:

.. code-block:: sh

  > ls rdbms2mongodb
  README.rst dataset java pre-flight.sh preflight.ps1 preflight.sh solutions solvethis.ps1 solvethis.sh

.. include:: /includes/student-notes.rst

.. only:: instructor

  .. note::

    Take some time to get the students acquainted with the directory structure.

    - In case students are using an IDE let them known that they can import the
      ``java`` folder as a Maven project.

    - The ``dataset`` folder contains two scripts, ``check.sql`` and
      ``create_schema.sql``, that they will use to initialize the relational
      database.

      - It also contains the dataset in both the ``dump`` directory that
        contains the MySQL files, and a ``csv`` directory where the data lives
        in a CSV format.


Launch a Local MySQL Server
---------------------------

Time to launch the relational database instance we will be migrating from:

- In your \*NIX system

.. code-block:: sh

  mysql.server start

- Or Windows

.. code-block:: ps1

  C:\> "C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 5.7\bin\mysqld"

.. include:: /includes/student-notes.rst

.. only:: instructor

  .. note::

    Although students should have already checked that they do have MySQL
    installed, make sure to ensure everyone actually does have it installed,
    and is able to complete these steps.

    - If they are on Unix and aren't finding mysql.start, it's in ``/usr/local/mysql/support-files``
    
    - ``mysqld`` should be ``/usr/local/mysql/bin``

    - If they installed on Mac using the installation files, they'll get some
      permissions issues when they run ``mysql.server start``

      - ``chmod -R 777 /usr/local/mysql/data`` should fix the problem.


Import the Data
---------------

Look into the ``rdbms2mongodb/dataset`` folder.

This contains the dataset that we will be working with.

To import this dataset:

.. code-block:: sh

  # creates the relational system schema
  mysql -uroot < dataset/create_schema.sql
  # imports previously generated dump
  mysql -uroot < dataset/dump/mongomart.sql
  # run a few checks - mandatory step!
  mysql -uroot < dataset/check.sql

And for those of you using Windows:

.. code-block:: bat

  cmd.exe /c "mysql -u root < dataset\create_schema.sql"
  cmd.exe /c "mysql -u root < dataset\dump\mongomart.sql"
  cmd.exe /c "mysql -u root < dataset\check.sql"

.. include:: /includes/student-notes.rst

.. only:: instructor

  .. note::

    Take some time to let the students perform this operation.

    - They might not be used to running shell commands, specially Windows people
    - Files have been generated in a Unix system. There might be some incompatibilities between file formats.
    - If so, have the students download the executable file available in this link:

    http://www.efgh.com/software/unix2dos.htm

    - Beware that `check.sql` is not optional. Make sure students do follow all
      all the instructions.

    - For mac users who have not yet changed their password, there will be a permission issue.

    .. code-block:: sh

      Please use --connect-expired-password option or invoke mysql in interactive mode.

    - If this happens, they may need to update their root password.

    .. code-block:: sh

      $ mysql -u root -p
      Enter password:

    .. code-block:: mysql

      > SET PASSWORD = PASSWORD('<new password>');

    then disconnect. Now they can log in as root with full privileges.

    If they use

    .. code-block:: mysql

      > SET PASSWORD = PASSWORD('')

    then they can connect without a password.


Run the ``mongomart`` App
-------------------------

Once we have our dataset fully imported, it is time for us to give
``mongomart`` a spin:

- First, generate the java package:

.. code-block:: sh

  mvn package -f java/pom.xml

- Next, run the application process:

.. code-block:: sh

  java -jar java/target/MongoMart-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar

.. include:: /includes/student-notes.rst

.. only:: instructor

  .. note::

      This might be a critical point for many students.
      Specially, make sure they have properly installed maven.

      - Make sure that everyone has correctly setup their $MAVEN_HOME and
        $JAVA_HOME in their environment $PATH
      - Students using the IDE and familiar with Maven might be running the
        process from the IDE itself.

        - Nevertheless it's nice to have students bring up the process, at least
          once, from the command line.

Final Step
----------

Once the process is up and running, the final step is to connect to
http://localhost:8080 using your system browser.
