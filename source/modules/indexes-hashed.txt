Learning Objectives
-------------------

Upon completing this module, students should understand:

- What a hashed index is
- When to use a hashed index

What is a Hashed Index?
-----------------------

- Hashed indexes are based on field values like any other index.
- The difference is that the values are hashed and it is the hashed value that is indexed.
- The hashing function collapses sub-documents and computes the hash for the entire value.
- MongoDB can use the hashed index to support equality queries.
- Hashed indexes do not support multi-key indexes, i.e. indexes on array fields.
- Hashed indexes do not support range queries.

Why Hashed Indexes?
-------------------

- In MongoDB, the primary use for hashed indexes is to support sharding a collection using a hashed shard key.
- In some cases, the field we would like to use to shard data would make it difficult to scale using sharding.
- Using a hashed shard key to shard a collection ensures an even distribution of data and overcomes this problem.
- See :manual:`Shard a Collection Using a Hashed Shard Key</tutorial/shard-collection-with-a-hashed-shard-key/>` for more details.
- We discuss sharding in detail in another module.

Limitations
-----------

- You may not create compound indexes that have hashed index fields.
- You may not specify a unique constraint on a hashed index.
- You can create both a hashed index and a non-hashed index on the same field.

   .. note::

      - For a field on which there is both a hashed index and a non-hashed index, MongoDB will use the non-hashed index for range queries.

Floating Point Numbers
----------------------

- MongoDB hashed indexes truncate floating point numbers to 64-bit integers before hashing.
- Do not use a hashed index for floating point numbers that cannot be reliably converted to 64-bit integers.
- MongoDB hashed indexes do not support floating point values larger than 2\ :sup:`53`.

Creating a Hashed Index
-----------------------

Create a hashed index using an operation that resembles the following. This operation creates a hashed index for the active collection on the ``a`` field.

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.active.createIndex( { a: "hashed" } )

.. include:: /includes/student-notes.rst
