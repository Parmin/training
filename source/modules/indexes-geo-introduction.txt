Geospatial Indexes
==================


Learning Objectives
-------------------

Upon completing this module, students should understand:

- Use cases of geospatial indexes
- The two types of geospatial indexes
- Other types of queries


Introduction to Geospatial Indexes
----------------------------------

- Geospatial indexes are used to quickly determine geometric relationships on a two-dimensional surface, such as:

  - All points within a circle
  - Whether or not points fall within a polygon
  - Whether or not two polygons intersect


Flat vs. Spherical Indexes
--------------------------

- There are two types of geospatial indexes

  - Flat, made with the '2d' index
  - Two-Dimensional Spherical, made with the '2dsphere' index

    - Takes into account the curvature of the earth
    - Joins any two points using a geodesic, or "great circle arc"


Flat Geospatial Index
---------------------

- This is a cartesian treatment of coordinate-pairs.
- Is naive to the fact that you are probably describing the surface of a sphere.
  
  - E.g., would NOT know that the shortest path from Canada to Siberia is over the North Pole (if units are degrees).
  - Can actually be used to describe any flat surface, not just the earth.

- Use Cartesian geometry rules here.
- Used with legacy coordinate pairs from MongoDB 2.2 or earlier.
- Recommended if:

  - You have legacy coordinate pairs.
  - You do not plan to use geoJSON objects such as LineStrings or Polygons.
  - You are not going to use points far enough North or South to worry about the Earth's curvature.


Spherical Geospatial Index
--------------------------

- Knows about the curvature of the Earth.
- If you want to plot the shortest path from the Klondike to Siberia, this will know to go over the North Pole.
- Uses geoJSON objects (Points, LineString, and Polygons).
- Coordinate pairs are converted into geoJSON Points.
