Security Introduction
=====================


Learning Objectives
-------------------

Upon completing this module students should understand:

- The high-level overview of security in MongoDB
- Security options for MongoDB

  - Authentication
  - Authorization
  - Transport Encryption
  - Enterprise only features


Overview
--------

.. include:: /images/security-architecture.rst

.. only:: instructor

  .. note::

    - MongoDB provides numerous security features, to include:

      - Authentication

        - SCRAM-SHA-1
        - x.509 Certificate Authentication

      - Authorization

        - Role-Based Access Control

      - Transport Encryption
      - Enterprise Only Features

        - Kerberos Authentication
        - LDAP Proxy Authentication
        - Encryption at Rest
        - Auditing

      - Network Exposure Settings

    - You should only run MongoDB in a trusted environment.
    - You should run MongoDB from a non-root user.
    - You are welcome to use any features you desire, or none.
    - All security is off by default. This will change, and versions >= 3.6 will be restricted to localhost by default


Authentication Options
----------------------

- Community

  - Challenge/response authentication using SCRAM-SHA-1 (username & password)
  - X.509 Authentication (using X.509 Certificates)

- Enterprise

  - All of Community
  - Kerberos
  - LDAP

.. only:: instructor

  .. note::

    - Although there is a SCRAM-SHA-2 algorithm that addressed some vulnerabilities in SCRAM-SHA-1, it would not benefit MongoDB
    - By cracking either algorithm an attacker would have to have access to the ``db.users`` collection and associated metadata


Authorization via MongoDB
-------------------------

- Predefined roles
- Custom roles
- LDAP authorization (MongoDB Enterprise)

  - Query LDAP server for groups to which a user belongs.
  - Distinguished names (DN) are mapped to roles on the ``admin`` database.
  - Requires external authentication (x.509, LDAP, or Kerberos).


Transport Encryption
--------------------

- TLS/SSL

  - May use certificates signed by a certificate authority or self-signed.

- FIPS (MongoDB Enterprise)

.. only:: instructor

   .. note::

      - FIPS (Federal Information Processing Standard)
      - Users should use a certificate from a certificate authority in order for clients to verify the server's identity

Network Exposure Options
------------------------

- ``bindIp`` limits the ip addresses the server listens on.
- Using a non-standard port can provide a layer of obscurity.
- MongoDB should still be run only in a trusted environment.
