Security - Introduction
=======================


Learning Objectives
-------------------

Upon completing this module, students should understand:

- which authentication options are available for MongoDB
- which authorization options are available for MongoDB
- Which network exposure and encryption options are available for MongoDB


Security - Overview
-------------------

- MongoDB offers security features from several angles:

  - Authentication: Is the client who they say they are?
  - Authorization: Is the client allowed to do this?
  - Network Exposure: Is this query or login coming from the place we expect?

- You are welcome to use any features you desire, or none.
- No security is on by default.


Authentication
--------------

- MONGODB-CR Authentication (username & password)
- x.509 Authentication (using x.509 Certificates)
- Kerberos (through an Enterprise subscription)
- LDAP (Not for Windows)
- User logs in on a particular client connection


Authorization
-------------

- Each user has a set of potential roles

  - read, readWrite, dbAdmin, etc.

- Roles apply to one particular database

  - User can have roles on each database
  - Some roles apply to all databases
  - You can create custom roles if built-in roles don't work.


Network Exposure
----------------

- bindIp can limit the origin of trusted incoming connections.
- Choosing a non-standard port provides a level of security.
- A The http interface is useful in dev environments but can be turned off in production.
- Firewalls can be configured for MongoDB
- MongoDB should still be run only in a trusted environment


Encryption
----------

- MongoDB can be configured at build time to run with SSL.

  - Binaries from the site are built without it, however, so you'll need to do your own build.
