==========================
Index Filters (new in 2.6)
==========================

Learning Objectives
-------------------

Upon completing this module, students should understand:

- How Index Filters work.
- When Index Filters apply.
- their priority vis-a-vis Query Plans and hints.

Index Filters - Overview
------------------------

- An index filter is a little bit like a hint.

  - It specifies a set of indexes to use, instead of specifyingjust one index to use.

- Lets you specify which indexes

Index Filters - Mechanics
-------------------------

- You give the database a query shape and an index filter.

  - This specifies those indices that the query plan can legitimately try.
  - Those outside the plan don’t get tried.

- If an index filter exists, it has a higher priority than a hint().
- Index filters exist until the server process dies, and do not persist. 

Index Filters - Usage
---------------------

- Since filters are accessed through db.runCommand, you won’t remember how to use them.
- Look them up in the documentation if you need to put them in place.
- Because they override .hint(), use index filters sparingly.
