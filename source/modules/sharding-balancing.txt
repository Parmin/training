Balancing Shards
================


Learning Objectives
-------------------

Upon completing this module students should understand:

- Chunks and the balancer
- The status of chunks in a newly sharded collection
- How chunk splits automatically occur
- Advantages of pre-splitting chunks
- How the balancer Works


Chunks and the Balancer
-----------------------

- Chunks are groups of documents.
- The shard key determines which chunk a document will be contained in.
- Chunks can be split when they grow too large.
- The balancer decides where chunks go.
- It handles migrations of chunks from one server to another.


Chunks in a Newly Sharded Collection
------------------------------------

- The range of a chunk is defined by the shard key values of the documents the chunk contains.
- When a collection is sharded it starts with just one chunk.
- The first chunk for a collection will have the range:

  .. code-block:: javascript

     { $minKey : 1 } to { $maxKey : 1 }

- All shard key values from the smallest possible to the largest fall in this chunk's range


Chunk Splits

   .. note::

      - When a chunk grows larger than the chunk size it will be split in half.
      - The default chunk size is 64MB.
      - A chunk can only be split between two values of a shard key.
      - If every document on a chunk has the same shard key value, it cannot be split.
      - This is why the shard key's cardinality is important
      - Chunk splitting is just a bookkeeping entry in the metadata. 
      - No data bearing documents are altered.


Pre-Splitting Chunks
--------------------

- You may pre-split data before loading data into a sharded cluster.
- Pre-splitting is useful if:

  - You plan to do a large data import early on
  - You expect a heavy initial server load and want to ensure writes are distributed.

   .. note::

      - A large data import will take time to split and balance without pre-splitting.


Start of a Balancing Round
--------------------------

- A balancing round may be initiated by any mongos in the cluster.
- This happens when the difference in the number of chunks between two shards becomes to large.
- Specifically, the difference between the shard with the most chunks and the shard with the fewest.
- A balancing round starts when the imbalance reaches:

  - 2 when the cluster has < 20 chunks
  - 4 when the cluster has 20-79 chunks
  - 8 when the cluster has 80+ chunks


Chunk Migration Steps
---------------------

#. The balancer process sends the moveChunk command to the source shard.
#. The source shard continues to process reads/writes for that chunk during the migration.
#. The destination shard requests documents in the chunk and begins receiving copies.
#. After receiving all documents, the destination shard receives any changes to the chunk.
#. Then the destination shard tells the config db that it has the chunk.
#. The destination shard will now handle all reads/writes.
#. The source shard deletes its copy of the chunk.


Concluding a Balancing Round
----------------------------

- Each chunk will move:

  - From the shard with the most chunks 
  - To the shard with the fewest

- A balancing round ends when all shards differ by at most one chunk.
