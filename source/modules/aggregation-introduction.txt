Aggregation - Basics
====================

    - Aggregation is used to analyze or transform data that is in
      MongoDB collections.
    - For those who are used to SQL, Aggregation is MongoDB's answer to the
      "GROUP BY" statement.
    - Aggregation works by using a "pipeline" (in analogy with unix pipes)
      where the data is passed from one stage to the next. Any stage can
      follow any other.
    - Aggregation will act on an entire collection, though you may filter
      some of the documents that you use.
