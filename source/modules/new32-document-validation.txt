===================
Document Validation
===================


Learing Objectives
------------------

Upon completing this module, students should be able to:

- Define the different types of document validation

  - And the use cases for each

- Create, discover, and bypass document validation in a collection
- List the restrictions on document validation

.. include:: /includes/student-notes.rst


Introduction to Document Validation
-----------------------------------

- Prevents or warns warns when the following occurs:

  - Insert/update of documents that don't match a schema

- Designed as a layer of protection against bugs in the application
- Can be implemented for a new or existing collection
- Can be bypassed, if necessary

.. include:: /includes/student-notes.rst


validationLevel
---------------

- Determines what to apply validation *to*
  
- Can be:
  
  - "strict" applies to:
  
    - All inserts and updates
  
  - "moderate" applies to:
    
    - All inserts
    - All updates of valid documents
    - **Not** to updates of currently invalid documents
  
  - *off*
  
    - Turns validation off entirely

.. include:: /includes/student-notes.rst


validationAction
----------------

- What to do when an invalid document is either

  - Inserted
  - Updated illegally

- Possible actions

  - *error* : rejects insertions/updates that violate the rule
  - *warn* : logs rule violations, but allows them to proceed

.. include:: /includes/student-notes.rst


Question
--------

- What are the uses for the two validationLevels?
- What are the uses for the two validationActions?

.. include:: /includes/student-notes.rst

  .. only:: instructor

    .. note::

      - After the next two slides, you can come back and review their answers


Document Validation Options: Use Cases
--------------------------------------

- validationLevel: "strict"

    - Useful when you're doing one of the following:

      - Changing a schema

        - All updates should map to the new schema

      - Creating a new collection
      - Validating an existing collection already in compliance

.. include:: /includes/student-notes.rst


Document Validation Options: Use Cases (continued)
--------------------------------------------------

- validationLevel: "moderate"

  - Useful when you're doing one of the following:

    - Changing a schema, and you haven't migrated fully
    - Application can't map the old schema to the new

.. include:: /includes/student-notes.rst


Document Validation Options: Use Cases (continued)
--------------------------------------------------

  - validationAction: "error"

    - Useful when:
    
      - The application needs to rely on valid documents
      - Applications can't be trusted to write properly
      - It is better to prevent invalid documents

.. include:: /includes/student-notes.rst


Document Validation Options: Use Cases (continued)
--------------------------------------------------

  - validationAction: "warn"

    - Useful when:

      - You need to receive all writes
      - Your application can handle other schemas
      - Tracking schema-related issues is important

.. include:: /includes/student-notes.rst

  .. only:: instructor

    .. note::

      - You can compare their answers to what you've discussed in this slide and the previous ones


Creating a Collection with Document Validation
----------------------------------------------

- Suppose you want the following rules:

  - At least one of the following:
  
    - The *phone* field is a string
    - The *email* field matches a regular expression
    - The *status* field is either "Unknown" or "Incomplete"

  - You want the *error* action, not *warn*

.. include:: /includes/student-notes.rst

.. only:: instructor

  .. note::

    - The students may ask if it's strict or moderate validation
    - Point out that it doesn't matter for new collections

      - All new inserts must be valid
      - All updates will be to valid documents

    - So it's always *strict* for a new collection
    - If you want the students to do it on their own, don't go to the next slide, yet


Creating a Collection with Document Validation (Continued)
----------------------------------------------------------

.. code-block:: javascript

  db.createCollection("contacts",
     {
        validator: { $or:
           [
              { phone: { $type: "string" } },
              { email: { $regex: /@mongodb\.com$/ } },
              { status: { $in: [ "Unknown", "Incomplete" ] } }
           ]
        },
        validationAction: "error"
     }
  )

.. include:: /includes/student-notes.rst


Seeing the Results of Validation
--------------------------------

To see what the validation rules are for all collections in a database:

.. code-block:: javascript

  db.getCollectionInfos()

And you can see the results when you try to insert:

.. code-block:: javascript

  db.contacts.insertOne( { _id : "Will", phone : "(112)-358-1321" } )  // will work
  db.contacts.insertOne( { _id : "John Snow", email : "john.snow@mongodb.com" } ) // will work
  db.contacts.insertOne( { _id : "Larry Page", email : "larry@google.com" } )  // won't work


.. include:: /includes/student-notes.rst


Adding Validation to an Existing Collection
-------------------------------------------

.. code-block:: javascript

  db.contacts.drop()
  db.contacts.insertOne( { _id : "Fibonacci", phone: "(112)-358-1321" } )
  db.contacts.insertOne( { _id : "Larry Page", email : "larry@google.com" } )  // will work
  db.runCommand( {
     collMod: "contacts",
     validator: { $or:
        [
           { phone: { $type: "string" } },
           { email: { $regex: /@mongodb\.com$/ } },
           { status: { $in: [ "Unknown", "Incomplete" ] } }
        ]
     },
     validationAction: "error",
     validationLevel: "moderate"
  } )
  db.contacts.updateOne( { _id : "Larry Page" }, { $set : { email : "nothing" } } )  // will work
  db.contacts.updateOne( { _id : "Fibonacci" }, { $set : { phone : null } } )  // will fail


.. include:: /includes/student-notes.rst

.. only:: instructor

  .. note::

    - First two inserts worked b/c there was no validation at first
    - The Larry Page update worked because the document was already invalid and "moderate" validationLevel will let them stay invalid
    - The Fibonacci update failed because the document was valid, and was moved to an invalid state.


Bypassing Document Validation
-----------------------------

- You can bypass document validation
- This is subject to user roles restrictions
- See documentation for details 
- Security roles: 

  - "dbAdmin" and "restore" can bypass validation
  - "bypassDocumentValidation" action can be set

.. include:: /includes/student-notes.rst

.. only:: instructor

  .. note::

    - User roles are covered in the security section


Limits of Document Validation
-----------------------------

- You cannot validate documents for the following databases:

  - admin
  - local
  - config

- Nor for collections that start with "system.*"
- Some user roles can still bypass validation
- Remember, validationLevel "warn" still allows invalid documents

.. include:: /includes/student-notes.rst


Question
--------

What are the validation levels available and what are the differences?

.. include:: /includes/student-notes.rst

.. only:: instructor

  .. note::

    Answers:

    - Strict - every insert or update must pass validation
    - Moderate - if the document doesn’t currently pass validation, you can update it in a way that doesn’t pass validation

      - But new documents must be validated, and once a document passes validation it must stay valid going forward

    - None - disables document validation


Question
--------

What command do you use to determine what the validation rule is for the *things* collection?

.. only:: instructor

  .. note::

    - Trick question. You can find out for all collections in the database with db.getCollectionInfos(), but there’s no way to do it for just one collection.


Question
--------

What three databases can’t have document validation? Why?

.. include:: /includes/student-notes.rst

.. only:: instructor

  .. note::

    - admin: holds security
    - local: holds the oplog and other replication information
    - config: holds sharding metadata
    - In each of these cases, MongoDB needs the data to work properly
