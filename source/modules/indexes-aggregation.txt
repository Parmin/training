- Why indexes may become unavailable after certain stages
- Which indexes can be used for special stages

Overview
--------

- Indexes can be used during the aggregation pipeline
- They are used automatically when possible.
- Stages need to have access to the documents that are indexed.
- Once documents have been transformed, it is difficult for indexes to operate.

------------------------------

- $match

  - Use as early as possible in order to take advantage of the index, and to reduce the size of the pipeline.

- $sort

  - Use as early as possible if it uses an index, in order to take advantage of that index.

- $limit or $skip

  - Good to use as early as possible, but no special benefit from indexes.

- $geoNear

  - Like the $nearSphere or $near search operator, it orders documents based on distance.
  - You must use it as the first stage.
  - Look at the documentation for details.

- $unwind and $group

  - These stages will form a break between the original documents and the later stages of the aggregation pipeline.
  - You will not be able to use any indexes after one of these stages occurs.
