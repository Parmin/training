=====================
Aggregation - Utility
=====================


The ``$sort`` Stage
-------------------

- Works like the ``.sort()`` cursor method
- 1 to sort ascending; -1 to sort descending

.. code-block:: js

   db.testcol.aggregate( [ { $sort : { b : 1, a : -1 } } ] )

.. include:: /includes/student-notes.rst


The ``$skip`` Stage
-------------------

- Works like the ``.skip()`` cursor method.
- Value is an integer specifying the number of documents to skip.
- The following will pass all but the first 3 documents to the next stage in the pipeline:

.. code-block:: js

   db.testcol.aggregate( [ { $skip : 3 }, ... ] )

.. include:: /includes/student-notes.rst


The ``$limit`` Stage
--------------------

- Used to limit the number of documents passed to the next aggregation stage.
- Works like the ``.limit()`` cursor method.
- Value is an integer.
- The following will only pass 3 documents to the stage that comes next in the pipeline:

.. code-block:: js

   db.testcol.aggregate( [ { $limit: 3 }, ... ] )

.. include:: /includes/student-notes.rst


The ``$count`` Stage
--------------------

- Used to count the number of documents that this stage receives in input
- The following would count all documents in a **users** collection with a **firstName** field set to "Mary"

.. code-block:: js

   db.users.aggregate([
     { $match: { firstName: "Mary" } },
     { $count: "usersNamedMary" }
   ])

The ``$sample`` Stage
---------------------

- Randomized sample of documents
- Useful for calculating statistics
- ``$sample`` provides an efficient means of sampling a data set
- If the sample size requested is larger than 5% of the collection ``$sample`` will perform a collection scan

   - Also happens if collection has fewer than 100 documents

- Can use ``$sample`` only as a first stage of the pipeline

   .. note::

      - The exact method is in the documentation.

        - `Link here <https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/operator/aggregation/sample/>`_


Example: ``$sample``
--------------------

.. literalinclude:: /includes/aggregation_scripts.js
   :language: javascript
   :start-after: begin sample example
   :end-before: end sample example


.. include:: /includes/student-notes.rst

.. only:: instructor

   .. note::

     - Users will want their sample sizes to be large enough to be useful.
     - 5 is too small for anything
     - A statistician may be required for determining how much is enough; it
       depends on the distribution of data

The ``$indexStats`` Stage
-------------------------

- Tells you how many times each index has been used since the server process began
- Must be the first stage of the pipeline
- Returns one document per index
- The ``accesses.ops`` field reports the number of times an index was used

.. include:: /includes/student-notes.rst

.. only:: instructor

   .. note::

     - Doesn't include all internal operations

       - TTL deletions or .explain() queries, for example


Example: ``$indexStats``
------------------------

Issue each of the following commands in the mongo shell, one at a time.

.. literalinclude:: /includes/aggregation_scripts.js
   :language: javascript
   :start-after: begin indexStats example
   :end-before: end indexStats example


.. only:: instructor

   .. note::

      - Point out the "accesses" doc, with ops, is 0 for the new index initially.
      - Ops incremented to 2 from the two find() queries.
      - The ``.next()`` operations are to get the DB to actually execute the query.
      - _id did not increment because we weren't using that index
      - Neither query changed its "since" field in the "accesses" doc
      - If using replication, the oplog will query on _id when replicating.


The ``$out`` Stage
------------------

- Creates a new collection from the output of the aggregation pipeline.
- Can only be the last stage in the pipeline.
- If a collection by the name already exists, it replaces that collection.

  - Will keep existing indexes in place


Example: ``$out``
-----------------

.. literalinclude :: /includes/aggregation_scripts.js
   :language: javascript
   :start-after: begin out example
   :end-before: end out example

.. include:: /includes/student-notes.rst
