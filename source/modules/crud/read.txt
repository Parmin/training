.. topic:: Upon completing this module, students should understand:

    - The "query by example" paradigm of MongoDB
    - How to project the query results
    - The behavior of the cursor returned
    - How to use find's daughter methods
        - sort 
        - count 
        - skip 
        - limit
    - Common operators

The find() Method
-----------------

    - This is the basic method of all reads.
    - You've already seen us use it in its basic form
    - db.collection.find() will return a cursor (which we'll talk about later)
      that returns all documents in the collection.

Query by Example
----------------

    - In order to get only a few documents, you specify just the field:value pairs 
      you want to match
    - Any field that you don't specify won't be filtered.
    - You'll get back all of the documents in the collection that match.

Exercise: Qeuerying by Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

First, let's create some documents to query.

.. code-block:: javascript

    db.moreStuff.insert( [ 
                           { _id : 1, a : 5, b : 3 },
                           { _id : 3, b : 5, c : 12 },
                           { a : 7 , b : 3 },
                           { a : 5, b : 7 } 
                         ] )

    db.moreStuff.find()
    db.moreStuff.find( { a : 5 } )
    db.moreStuff.find( { _id : 1 } )
