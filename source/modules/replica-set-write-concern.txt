Learning Objectives
-------------------

Upon completing this module students should understand:

- How and when rollback occurs in MongoDB.
- The tradeoffs between durability and performance.
- Write concern as a means of ensuring durability in MongoDB.
- The different levels of write concern.


What happens to the write?
--------------------------

- A write is sent to a primary.
- The primary acknowledges the write to the client.
- And then the primary becomes unavailable before a secondary can replicate the write


Answer
------

- Another member might be elected primary.
- It will not have the last write that occured before the previous primary became unavailable.
- When the previous primary becomes available again:
  
  - It will note it has writes that were not replicated.
  - It will put these writes into a ``rollback file``.  
  - A human will need to determine what to do with this data.

- This is default behavior in MonogDB and can be controlled using ``write concern``.


Balancing Durability with Performance
-------------------------------------

- The previous scenario is a specific instance of a common distributed systems problem.
- For some applications it might be acceptable for writes to be rolled back.
- Other applications may have varying requirements with regard to durability.
- Tunable write concern:

  - Make critical operations persist to an entire MongoDB deployment.
  - Specify replication to fewer nodes for less important operations.

   .. notes::

      - MongoDB provides tunable write concern to better address the specific needs of applications. 
      - Clients may adjust write concern to ensure that the most important operations persist successfully to an entire MongoDB deployment. 
      - For other less critical operations, clients can adjust write concern to ensure faster performance.


Defining Write Concern
----------------------

- Clients may define ``write concern`` per operation.
- If necessary, ``write concern`` can be different for every write.
- Standardize on a specific levels of ``write concern`` for different classes of writes.
- In the discussion that follows we will look at increasingly strict levels of write concern.


Write Concern: ``{ w : 1 }``
----------------------------

.. only:: instructor

   .. notes::

      - We refer to this write concern as "Acknowledged".
      - This is the default.
      - The primary sends an acknowledgement back to the client that it received the write operation.
      - Allows clients to catch network, duplicate key, and other write errors.


Example: ``{ w : 1 }``
----------------------

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.edges.insert( { "from" : "tom185", "to" : "mary_p" }, 
                    { w : 1 } )



Write Concern: ``{ w : 2 }``
----------------------------

.. figure:: /images/crud-write-concern-w2.png
   :width: 500px

.. only:: instructor

   .. notes::

      - Called "Replica Acknowledged"
      - Ensures the primary completed the write.
      - Ensures at least one secondary replicated the write.  


Example: ``{ w : 2 }``
----------------------

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.customer.update( { user : "mary_p" }, 
                       { $push : { shoppingCart : { _id : 335443, 
                                                    name : "Brew-a-cup",
                                                    price : 45.79 } } },
                       { w : 2 } )
 


Other Write Concerns
--------------------

- You may specify any integer as the value of the w field for write concern.
- This guarantees that write operations have propagated to the specified number of members.
- E.g., { w : 3 }, { w : 4}, etc.


Write Concern: Majority
-----------------------

- { w : "majority" }
- Ensures the primary completed the write.
- Ensures write operations have propagated to a majority of a replica set's members.
- Avoids hard coding assumptions about the size of your replica set into your application.
- Using majority will sacrifice performance for durability.
- It is suitable for critical writes.


Example: Majority
-----------------

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.products.update( { _id : 335443 },
                       { $inc : { inStock : -1 } },
                       { w : "majority" } )



Quiz: Which write concern is best suited?
-----------------------------------------

Suppose you have a replica set with seven data-bearing members. Your application has critical inserts for which you do not want rollback to happen. Secondaries may be taken down from to time for maintenance leaving you with a potential 4-server replica set. Which write concern is best suited for these critical inserts?

Choices

- 1
- 2
- 3
