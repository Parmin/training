===============================

Learning Objectives
-------------------

Upon completing this module students should understand:

- How to insert documents into MongoDB collections.
- ``_id`` fields:
- How to delete documents from a collection
- How to remove a collection from a database
- How to remove a database from a MongoDB deployment

.. include:: /includes/student-notes.rst


Creating New Documents
----------------------

- Create documents using ``insertOne()`` and ``insertMany().
- For example:

  .. code-block:: javascript

     // Specify the collection name
     db.<COLLECTION>.insertOne( { "name" : "Mongo" } )

     // For example
     db.people.insertOne( { "name" : "Mongo" } )

.. include:: /includes/student-notes.rst


Example: Inserting a Document
------------------------------

Experiment with the following commands.

.. code-block:: javascript

   use sample

   db.movies.insertOne( { "title" : "Jaws" } )

   db.movies.find()

.. include:: /includes/student-notes.rst

.. only:: instructor

   .. note::
        
      - Make sure the students are performing the operations along with you.
      - Some students will have trouble starting things up, so be helpful at this stage.


Implicit ``_id`` Assignment
---------------------------

- We did not specify an ``_id`` in the document we inserted.
- If you do not assign one, MongoDB will create one automatically.
- The value will be of type ObjectId.

.. include:: /includes/student-notes.rst


Example: Assigning _ids
------------------------

Experiment with the following commands.

.. code-block:: javascript

    db.movies.insertOne( { "_id" : "Jaws", "year" : 1975 } )
    db.movies.find()

.. include:: /includes/student-notes.rst

.. only:: instructor

   .. note::

      - Note that you can assign an _id to be of almost any type.
      - It does not need to be an ObjectId.


Inserts will fail if...
-----------------------

- There is already a document in the collection with that ``_id``.
- You try to assign an array to the ``_id``.
- The argument is not a well-formed document.

.. include:: /includes/student-notes.rst


Example: Inserts will fail if...
---------------------------------

.. code-block:: javascript

   // fails because _id can't have an array value
   db.movies.insertOne( { "_id" : [ "Star Wars", 
                                    "The Empire Strikes Back", 
                                    "Return of the Jedi" ] } )

   // succeeds
   db.movies.insertOne( { "_id" : "Star Wars" } )

   // fails because of duplicate id
   db.movies.insertOne( { "_id" : "Star Wars" } )

   // malformed document
   db.movies.insertOne( { "Star Wars" } )

.. include:: /includes/student-notes.rst

.. only:: instructor

   .. note::

      - The following will fail because it attempts to use an array as an ``_id``.

        .. code-block:: javascript

           db.movies.insertOne( { "_id" : [ "Star Wars", "The Empire Strikes Back", "Return of the Jedi" ] } )

      - The second insert with ``_id : "Star Wars"`` will fail because there is already a document with ``_id`` of "Star Wars" in the collection.

      - The following will fail because it is a malformed document (i.e. no field name, just a value).

      .. code-block:: javascript

         db.movies.insertOne( { "Star Wars" } )


insertMany
----------

- You may bulk insert using an array of documents.
- Use ``insertMany()`` instead of ``insertOne()``

.. only:: instructor

   .. note::

      - In the case of an ordered bulk operation, every operation will be executed in the order they are added to the bulk operation. 
      - In the case of an unordered bulk operation however there is no guarantee what order the operations are executed. 
      - With an unordered bulk operation, the operations in the list may be reordered to increase performance.

.. include:: /includes/student-notes.rst


Ordered insertMany
------------------

- For ordered inserts MongoDB will stop processing inserts upon encountering an error.
- Meaning that only inserts occurring before an error will complete.
- The default setting for ``db.<COLLECTION>.insertMany`` is an ordered insert.
- See the next exercise for an example.

.. include:: /includes/student-notes.rst


Example: Ordered insertMany
---------------------------

Experiment with the following insertMany.

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.movies.insertMany( [ { "_id" : "Batman", "year" : 1989 },
                           { "_id" : "Home Alone", "year" : 1990 }, 
                           { "_id" : "Ghostbusters", "year" : 1984 },
                           { "_id" : "Ghostbusters", "year" : 1984 } ] )
   db.movies.find()

.. include:: /includes/student-notes.rst

.. only:: instructor

   .. note:: 

      - This example has a duplicate key error.
      - Only the first 3 documents will be inserted.

    
Unordered insertMany
--------------------

- Pass ``{ ordered : false }`` to insert to perform unordered inserts.
- If any given insert fails, MongoDB will still attempt all of the others.
- The inserts may be executed in a different order than you specified.
- The next exercise is very similar to the previous one.
- However, we are using ``{ ordered : false }`` 
- One insert will fail, but all the rest will succeed. 

.. include:: /includes/student-notes.rst


Example: Unordered insertMany
-----------------------------

Experiment with the following insert.

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.movies.insertMany( [ { "_id" : "Jaws", "year" : 1975 },
                           { "_id" : "Titanic", "year" : 1997 }, 
                           { "_id" : "The Lion King", "year" : 1994 } ], 
                           { ordered : false } )
   db.movies.find()

.. include:: /includes/student-notes.rst


The Shell is a JavaScript Interpreter
-------------------------------------

- Sometimes it is convenient to create test data using a little JavaScript.
- The mongo shell is a fully-functional JavaScript interpreter. You may:

  - Define functions
  - Use loops
  - Assign variables
  - Perform inserts

.. include:: /includes/student-notes.rst

Deleting Documents
------------------

You may delete documents from a MongoDB deployment in several ways.

- Use ``deleteOne()`` and ``deleteMany()`` to delete documents matching a specific set of conditions.
- Drop an entire collection.
- Drop a database.

.. include:: /includes/student-notes.rst


Using ``deleteOne()``
---------------------

- Delete a document from a collection using ``deleteOne()``
- This command has one required parameter, a query document.
- The first document in the collection matching the query document will be deleted.

.. include:: /includes/student-notes.rst


Using ``deleteMany()``
---------------------

- Delete multiple documents from a collection using ``deleteMany()``.
- This command has one required parameter, a query document.
- All documents in the collection matching the query document will be deleted.
- Pass an empty document to delete all documents.

.. include:: /includes/student-notes.rst

Example: Deleting Documents
----------------------------

Experiment with removing documents. Do a ``find()`` after each ``deleteMany()`` command below.

.. code-block:: javascript

   for (i=1; i<=20; i++) { db.testcol.insertOne( { _id : i, a : i } ) }

   db.testcol.deleteMany( { a : 1 } )  // Delete the first document

   // $lt is a query operator that enables us to select documents that
   // are less than some value. More on operators soon.
   db.testcol.deleteMany( { a : { $lt : 5 } } )  // Remove three more

   db.testcol.deleteOne( { a : { $lt : 10 } } )  // Remove one more

   db.testcol.deleteMany()  // Error: requires a query document.

   db.testcol.deleteMany( { } )  // All documents removed

.. include:: /includes/student-notes.rst


Dropping a Collection
---------------------

- You can drop an entire collection with ``db.<COLLECTION>.drop()``
- The collection and all documents will be deleted.
- It will also remove any metadata associated with that collection.
- Indexes are one type of metadata removed.
- More on meta data later.

.. include:: /includes/student-notes.rst

.. only:: instructor

   .. note::

      Mention that ``drop()`` is more performant than ``deleteMany()`` because of the costs associated with ``deleteMany()``, which pulls documents into memory and deletes them one at a time.


Example: Dropping a Collection
-------------------------------

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.colToBeDropped.insertOne( { a : 1 } )
   show collections  // Shows the colToBeDropped collection

   db.colToBeDropped.drop()
   show collections  // collection is gone

.. include:: /includes/student-notes.rst


Dropping a Database
-------------------

- You can drop an entire database with ``db.dropDatabase()``
- This drops the database on which the method is called.
- It also deletes the associated data files from disk, freeing disk space.
- Beware that in the mongo shell, this does not change database context.  

.. include:: /includes/student-notes.rst


Example: Dropping a Database
-----------------------------

.. code-block:: javascript

   use tempDB
   db.testcol1.insertOne( { a : 1 } )
   db.testcol2.insertOne( { a : 1 } )

   show dbs  // Here they are
   show collections  // Shows the two collections

   db.dropDatabase()
   show collections  // No collections
   show dbs  // The db is gone

   use sample  // take us back to the sample db

.. include:: /includes/student-notes.rst
