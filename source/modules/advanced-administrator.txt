Advanced Administrator Course
=============================


Learning Objectives
-------------------

Upon completing this training, students should understand:

- How to install and configure a highly available Ops Manager deployment
- Understand all the necessary components and architecture choices for an Ops
  Manager deployment
- How to effectively manage clusters using Ops Manager
- How to deploy and operate secured MongoDB deployments

.. only:: instructor

  .. note::

    You should be familiar with the tools to setup the hosts for this course.
    More details at:

      - https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vhA6NvlTsPe1rw_fb7N5NrYzJ78odiHWBd5yf9vPd64

    For this workshop, we will group students into teams.

    - There will be a maximum of 9 teams!

    At this point you should have created the infrastructure for the students
    and be retrieving its configuration by running the following command that
    will create the /tmp/<run>* files with all the info about IPs, LBs, VPCs:

    .. code-block:: sh

      ./describe.py --run <TRAINING-RUN> --out /tmp/advadmin


Hands-on Approach
-----------------

This training is a full hands-on experience.

- You will be given access to a set of AWS instances.
- You are expected to work in teams. So you will be sharing a set of machines
  with your colleagues.
- All the necessary software will be available within those same instances
- However, all architecture decisions and configuration steps will be made by
  the students
- Use the instructor for guidance and advice but he should mostly be there for
  observation and time boxing the labs.

  .. note::

    - show the students how many teams have been created


Expected Takeaways
------------------

There are a few important objectives that we want to accomplish by the end of
this course:

- Understand the necessary infrastructure needed to run Ops Manager
- Understand the different architecture choices and their tradeoffs in different
  deployments
- Understand the different options that Ops Manager offers for backup
- Clear understanding of the benefits of using Ops Manager to manage different
  clusters
- Deploy secured, monitored, and fully managed infrastructure for your application


.. only:: instructor

  .. note::

    Make sure the students understand that, for this completion of this course,
    they are expected to have a significant experience with MongoDB, and that we
    assume that terms like:

    - Replica Set
    - Shard Cluster
    - mongos
    - mongod
    - config servers
    - indexes
    - shard keys
    - ...

    are very familiar to the them.

Take your time, ask questions
-----------------------------

It's important to foster the discussion of different options and review
those options so:

- Use the whiteboard (if available)
- Talk to your team members to defined clear tasks and responsibilities
- Use the instructor for guidance and ask for advice
- Take chances, break stuff!

.. only:: instructor

  .. note::

    Reinforce that this is the perfect opportunity for students to make
    experiments and test configuration options.

    You are there to guide them but they should make use of this time to
    actually put in practice some ideas and check if they would work, in the
    context of the exercises in hand

    At this point you should assemble the teams and share the teams
    machine details files.

.. include:: /includes/student-notes.rst


Let's review what we have
-------------------------

Once we have our teams assembled it is time to do our first checklist.

Within your team configuration file you should have:

- Load balancer address.
- Public and private ip address for each AWS instance.
- An internal VPC set of ip addresses for each instance.
- 3 `<opsmgr>` instances.
- Up to 12 `<node>` instances.
- `AdvancedAdministrator.pem` key file to allow access to the instances.

.. only:: instructor

  .. note::

    At this point you should make sure the students have all the necessary files
    needed to access the infrastructure.

    - everyone should be assigned to one team, max of 3 person teams
    - check if everyone has their team configuration file

    You may want to explain to the students that:

    - each team works in under their private vpc

    - to navigate and configure the infrastructure, students should be using
      the ``/etc/hosts`` defined names

.. include:: /includes/student-notes.rst


Exercise: Accessing your instances
----------------------------------

- get your .pem file and close the permissions on it

.. code-block:: sh

   chmod 600 AdvancedAdministrator.pem

- enable the keychain and ``ssh`` into ``node1``, propagating your credentials

.. code-block:: sh

   ssh-add -K AdvancedAdministrator.pem
   ssh -i AdvancedAdministrator.pem -A centos@54.235.1.1

- ssh into ``node2`` from ``node1``

.. code-block:: sh

   ssh -A node2

.. include:: /includes/student-notes.rst


Exercise: Accessing your instances from a Windows client
--------------------------------------------------------


Solution: Accessing your instances
----------------------------------

In our machines we will have access to all nodes in the deployment:

.. code-block:: sh

    cat /etc/hosts

A ``/share/downloads`` folder with all necessary software downloaded

.. code-block:: sh

    ls /share/downloads

.. only:: instructor

  .. note::

    - quickly describe the contents of the dirs under ``downloads``
      Don't emphasis ``validation``, this is where your validation scripts are
