MMS Backups: Behind the Scenes
------------------------------

- Local copy of every replica set stored by MMS Backups
- Oplog entries applies on top of local copy
- Local copy is used for snapshotting
- Very little impact to the cluster (equivalent to adding another secondary)
  

MMS Backups: Behind the Scenes
------------------------------

- Backup agent (can be managed by Automation agent)
- Backup agent sends oplog entries to MMS service to be apply on local copy
