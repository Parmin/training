============================
Java Driver Labs (MongoMart)
============================


Introduction
------------

- In this lab, we'll set up and optimize an application called MongoMart.  MongoMart is an on-line store for buying MongoDB merchandise.

   .. note::

      - Student skeleton code is located in /student/java
      - Ensure data is correctly loaded from /student/data


Lab: Setup and Connect to the Database
--------------------------------------

- Import the "item" collection to a standalone MongoDB server (without replication) as noted in the README.md file of the /data directory of MongoMart
- Become familiar with the structure of the Java application in /java/src/main/java/mongomart/
- Modify the MongoMart.java class to properly connect to your local database instance

      - Please type in solution with the class instead of distributing source code


Lab: Populate All Necessary Database Queries
--------------------------------------------

- After running the MongoMart.java class, navigate to "localhost:8080" to view the application
- Initially, all data is static and the application does not query the database
- Modify the ItemDao.java and CartDao.java classes to ensure all information comes from the database (do not modify the method return types or parameters)

Lab: Use a Local Replica Set with a Write Concern
-------------------------------------------------

- It is important to use replication for production MongoDB instances, however, Lab 1 advised us to use a standalone server.
- Convert your local standalone mongod instance to a three node replica set named "shard1"
- Modify MongoMart's MongoDB connection string to include at least two nodes from the replica set
- Modify your application's write concern to MAJORITY for all writes to the "cart" collection, any writes to the "item" collection should continue using the default write concern of W:1
