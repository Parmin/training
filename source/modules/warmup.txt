.. topic:: Learning objectives

    - Students and instructor get familiar with one another.
    - Get used to your surroundings.
    - Demonstrate that you start the class on time. 

Introduce yourself and tell the students a little of your story:

- What is your primary role? 
- What is your background and prior experience?

Take attendance:

- Take attendance by asking the students to go around the room and state their names.
- Make sure the names you have match the roster of attendees provided by the training team.
- Get a sense of who the students are.
- Ask about what roles the students play in their organization. 
  - Note roles where provided on the attendance sheet. This helps in better understanding what leads the students in the classroom provide.
- Ask about software stacks used:
  - With MongoDB
  - In general
  - Note this informaton as well.

Survey the students a little with the following questions:

- Show of hands, who has never used MongoDB?
- Who has some experience?
- Who has worked with production MongoDB deployments?
- Who is more of a dev?
- Who is more of operations person?

Origin of MongoDB:

- MongoDB was initially created in 2008 as part of a hosted application stack built by a company called 10gen. 
- The original idea for 10gen didn’t take off, so the founders looked at what they had and asked themselves what was popular. 
- What people really liked most was the data access layer.
- Originally, this layer wasn't meant to be public facing, so there wasn't a real interface. 
- The CTO said OK, we’re going to be a database company, and we're going to build interfaces. 
- CEO & CTO have started a couple of startups, most famously ShopWiki, the Internet shopping search engine, Gilt, and Music Nation.
- With lots of experience building applications, the designers of MongoDB had started with relational databases.
- Over time they observed the same pattern:
  - The user base grows
  - The associated body of data grows
  - Eventually the application outgrows the database and keeping pace with performance requirements becomes extremely difficult.
- MongoDB is designed to scale with modern application development in mind.
