10gen
-----

- MongoDB was initially created in 2008 as part of a hosted application stack.
- The company was originally called 10gen.
- The original idea for 10gen didn’t take off.
- The founders looked at what they had and asked themselves what was popular. 
- What people really liked most was the data access layer.
- This layer wasn't meant to be public facing, so there wasn't a real interface. 


Origin of MongoDB
-----------------

- Eliot Horowitz (CTO) said, " OK, we’re going to be a database company."
- "We are going to build interfaces."
- Dwight Merriman and Eliot Horowitz have other startups to their credit: DoubleClick, ShopWiki, Gilt, and Music Nation.
- Through their experiences with these companies they observed the same pattern:

  - The user base grows.
  - The associated body of data grows.
  - Eventually the application outgrows the database.
  - Keeping pace with performance requirements becomes difficult.

- MongoDB is designed to scale with modern application development in mind.
