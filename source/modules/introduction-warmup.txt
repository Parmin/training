10gen

Origin of MongoDB
-----------------

- 10gen became a database company.
- In 2013, the company rebranded as MongoDB, Inc.
- The founders have other startups to their credit: DoubleClick, ShopWiki, Gilt.
- The motivation for the database came from observing the following pattern with application development.

  - The user base grows.
  - The associated body of data grows.
  - Eventually the application outgrows the database.
  - Meeting performance requirements becomes difficult.
