   .. note::

      - Mongomart is in the training repo in the /mongomart directory. Distribute the materials in the /mongomart/student subdirectory to students.
      - Ensure you have a fully running version of the instructor MongoMart implementation: /instructor/java/final
      - The instructor version requires a three node replica set (uses MAJORITY writes)
      - Ensure you've loaded the dataset from /mongomart/student/data and create a text index (as described in the /mongomart/student/data/README.md file)
      - DO NOT WALK THROUGH THIS VERSION OF THE SOURCE CODE WITH THE STUDENTS, ONLY THE STUDENT VERSION
