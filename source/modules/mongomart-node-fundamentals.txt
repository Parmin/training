Lab: Populate All Necessary Database Queries
--------------------------------------------

- After running the mongomart.js module, navigate to "localhost:3000" to view
  the application
- Initially, all data will be static, and the application cannot query the database
- Modify the ``items.js`` and ``cart.js`` classes to ensure all information comes from
  the server 
  
  - Do not modify the method return types or parameters
