  replication) of the /mongomart/data directory.

Lab: Populate All Necessary Database Queries
--------------------------------------------

- After running the mongomart.js module, navigate to "localhost:3000" to view
  the application
- Initially, all data is static and the application does not query the database
- Modify the items.js and cart.js classes to ensure all information comes from
  the database (do not modify the method return types or parameters)
