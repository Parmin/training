Learning Objectives
-------------------

Upon completing this module, students should understand:

- How to use Compass to explore and visualize schema
- Point and click queries
- GeoJSON queries
- How to use Compass to update a document

      - If you have not covered the basics of compass, click below to give the students a brief overview

Using Compass to Visualize Schema
---------------------------------

- Schema tab shows an overview of document schema, to include types
- Based on a sample of the overall collection, up to 1000 documents
- Fields can be clicked for interactive query and further visualization


Lesson Setup
------------

- Import the ``trips.json`` collection to a running ``mongod``

.. code-block:: js

   mongoimport --drop -d citibike -c trips trips.json

- Connect to your ``mongod`` with Compass and select the trips collection


Compass Visualization

   .. note::

      - This is only a sample, scroll down to show the full schema


Compass Interactive Queries
---------------------------

.. figure:: /images/schema-selection.svg

.. only:: instructor

   .. note::

      - In the image, we've selected the largest distribution of ``"start station name"`` by clicking on the bar
      - Students will see the bar highlight orange when it is selected
      - After students have made the selection instruct them to click the apply button, illustrating point and click queries


Visualizing geoJSON
-------------------

.. figure:: /images/geoJson-visualization.svg

.. only:: instructor

   .. note::

      - The image shows the result of the previous point and click query
      - It also shows the schema and values of a sample of the returned documents, in this case all of them
      - This is because our returned result set is smaller than the default sample size
      - The map is fully interactive. Pan and zoom in/out

Interactively Build a geoJSON query
-----------------------------------

- Select the "start station location" visualizer
- Pan the map around and find a location that interests you
- If you are unfamiliar with New York and Manhattan, pan down to Battery Park on the furthest most southwest tip of Manhattan
- Center your mouse in your area of interest, hold shift, click and drag outwards
- You will see an orange circle appear, and the filter/query bar being updated to include a ``$geoWithin`` query
- When you are satisfied, click apply to see the results

geoJSON Query Results
---------------------

.. only:: instructor

   .. note::

      - In this image we've centered on Union Square and expanded our circle to encompass the 3 closest stations


Documents Explorer
------------------

- After executing your query, navigate to the ``documents`` tab
- Mouse over one of the documents
- In the upper right corner of the results window you'll see a toolbar
- This allows us to expand, edit, delete, or clone the document with a single click
- Click the pencil icon

Updating a Document
-------------------

Updating Detail
---------------

- Document update allows many things, including:

  - Adding or deleting fields
  - Changing the value of fields
  - Changing the type of fields, for example from Int32 to Int64 or Decimal128

.. only:: instructor

   .. note::

      - If you have covered document validation, have students enable strict validation on one of the fields
      - Then, have students try to update that field to a different type
