Lab: Improve How Reviews are Stored and Queried
-----------------------------------------------

- Currently, all reviews are stored in an "item" document, within a "reviews"
  array.  This is problematic for the cases when the number of reviews for a
  product becomes extremely large.
- Create a new collection called "review" and modify the "reviews" array within
  the "item" collection to only contain the last 10 reviews.
- Modify the application to update the last 10 reviews for an item, the average
  number of stars (based on reviews) for an item, and insert the review into the
  new "review" collection

Lab: Related Items

- Modify each item document to include an array of "related_items" (maximum is 4).
- Related items should include other items within the same category
- Randomized items can be used if there are less than 4.
