Monitoring in MMS / Ops Manager
-------------------------------

- Identify cluster performance issues
- Identify individual nodes in cluster with performance issues
- Visualize performance through graphs and overlays
- Configure and set alerts

.. include:: /includes/student-notes.rst


Monitoring Use Cases
--------------------

- Alert on performance issues, to catch them before they turn into an outage
- Diagnose performance problems
- Historical performance analysis
- Monitor cluster health
  
.. include:: /includes/student-notes.rst


Monitoring Agent
----------------

- Requests metrics from each host in the cluster
- Sends those metrics to MMS / Ops Manager server
- Must be able to contact every host in the cluster (agent can live in a private network)
- Must have access to contact MMS / Ops Manager website with metrics from hosts
  
.. include:: /includes/student-notes.rst

  
Agent Configuration
-------------------

- Can use HTTP proxy
- Can gather hardware statistics via munin-node
- Agent can optionally gather database statistics, and record slow queries (sampled)
  
.. include:: /includes/student-notes.rst


Agent Security
--------------

- SSL certificate for SSL clusters
- LDAP/Kerberos supported
- Agent must have "clusterMonitor" role on each host

Monitoring Demo
---------------

Visit mms.mongodb.com

.. only:: instructor

   .. note::

      - The 10gen mongo-perf group may be interesting for demo'ing to the class

  
Navigating MMS Charts
---------------------

- Add charts to view by clicking the name of the chart at the bottom of the host's page
- "i" icon next to each chart title can be clicked to learn what the chart means
- Holding down the left mouse button and dragging on top of the chart will let you zoom in

.. include:: /includes/student-notes.rst


Metrics
-------

- Minute-level metrics for 48 hours
- Hourly metrics for about 3 months
- Daily metrics for the life of the cluster
  
.. include:: /includes/student-notes.rst


Alerts
------

- Every chart can be alerted on
- Changes to the state of the cluster can trigger alerts (e.g. a failover)
- Alerts can be sent to email, SMS, HipChat, or PagerDuty
