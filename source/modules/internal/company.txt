Hi! I'm ...
-----------

- Name
- Location
- Position (CE, SA, TSE, Dev, Docs, Ops, ... )
- Relevant experience before MongoDB
- Something funny or anecdote about you

.. include:: /includes/student-notes.rst

.. only:: instructor

  .. note::

    - This is a good time to quickly write their names down in a layout that match the class, to help remember their names
    - Make sure people are comfortable
    - Point out that they will be working in groups throughout the training

      - try to have teams where you have a mix of roles, not all SAs in one team for example.


Goal of the Training
--------------------

- Try to get people up to speed as quickly as possible on:

  - How MongoDB is supposed to work
  - How MongoDB does not work

- Get to

  - Come to the mothership (NYC)
  - Meet people
  - Ask questions

.. include:: /includes/student-notes.rst

.. only:: instructor

  .. note::

    - make sure people know to ask a lot of questions
    - tell students ask for deep technical questions
    - words of wisdom, from Richard...

      - “There is no fact about MongoDB that you absolutely need to know in order to do your job effectively and there is probably no fact that if you don’t know it that will be the end of the world”
      - “Don’t make guesses, there is a lot in MongoDB that may not behave the way you expect.”
      - “Don’t get caught saying MongoDB works like that, while it works differently. Once you lose their confidence and trust as a consultant or TSE, it is very difficult to gain back. They will stop listening to you about everything, even when you are right.”
      - It is OK to say: “I don’t know how it works, but let me find it out for you.”

    - NHTT history

      - At the beginning of MongoDB, every technical person was involved in support
        Training started around 2012, running for 4 years
        Now, we are more specialized, support mainly done by Technical Support Engineers, consultation by Consulting Engineers, …


Company History
---------------

- 2007: 10gen is founded
- 2008: Business model changed from full stack SAAS to focus on storage layer
- 2009: MongoDB v1.0 is released (9 people)
- 2013: 10gen renamed to MongoDB (250 people)
- 2014: Acquired WiredTiger (425 people)
- 2016: Atlas (700 people)
- 2017:

.. include:: /includes/student-notes.rst

.. only:: instructor

  .. note::

    - we started with a different idea - therefore the name 10gen (second gen)
    - we have several other products like Ops Manager or Cloud Manager.
    - notes on history:

      - Founded 10 years ago (2007), under the name 10gen by Dwight Merriman (Chairman of the board) and Elliott Horowitz (CTO), and Kevin Ryan.
      - Dwight has been the founder of Double Click before, where Elliot joined as an intern from college
      - Original intention was to develop a product: Software As A Service
      - Built storage layer (P), application layer and one programmatic language that resembles JavaScript (Babble?)
      - Then came Google Apps Engine around the same time
      - In late 2008, the company pivoted and just focused on the storage layer, and let most people go.
      - MongoDB was called ‘P’ for “Persistence’. It was a key/value store, based on JSON which evolved in to BSON
      - Turning the DB into a product required: adding indexes on other than primary keys, query language, reads and updates on more than one document. All those after thoughts reflect in the current architecture and behaviors of MongoDB as of today.

Open Source Model (continued)
-----------------------------

- `Open Source` is more to protect us and our customers than to accept contributions

    questions to ask:

    - What is AGPL? Affero General Public License

    - What does it mean that third party can't distribute our binaries? What if they are included on their software?

    - If I embed MongoDB on a binary? is this a violation of our license?

      - No, but they cannot sell support on that component of their product. Generally we will get a OEM license model for these situations
