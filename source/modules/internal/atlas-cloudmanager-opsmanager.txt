====================================
Atlas, Cloud Manager and Ops Manager
====================================


Learning Objectives
-------------------

.. rst-class:: build

- differences between *Atlas*, *Cloud Manager* (CM) and *Ops Manager* (OM)
- components of *Ops Manager*
- communication between the agents and the servers
- typical deployments of *Ops Manager*


Pre-requisites
--------------

- you have access to *Cloud Manager*
- you listen to the videos listed in the NHTT Wiki page

.. only:: instructor

   .. note::

      This is what we assume the students know
      You can quickly test their knowledge


Comparing Atlas, Cloud Manager and Ops Manager
----------------------------------------------


.. only:: instructor

   .. note::

      - prices per solution


.. only:: instructor

   .. note::

      - *Ops Manager* is basically *Cloud Manager* that we package and ship to customers.
      - Per one of our VP, writting a cloud product that you also ship to customer is challenging, as it is very difficult to excel at both skills.
.. only:: todo

   - find table/image showing the 3 products side-by-side (MDB World 2016?)


Atlas
-----

- This is a key product of our strategy as a company
- It scales easily
- Can have tremendous growth

.. only:: instructor

   .. note::

      - [STORY] *Atlas* was coined by a new hire (Daniel Farrell) while attending NHTT. He did not like the names on the ballot, so he submitted *Atlas*, and got enough other people to back up his choice, that we had a second ballot.


Ops Manager
-----------

- Very sticky feature of our subscriptions, especially if used for backups

  - you need a subscription to continue using it

- Only easy way to manage your deployments without connecting to the outside


What is MMS?
------------

.. only:: instructor

   .. note::

      - [STORY] how we went from *MongoDB Monitoring Service* to *MongoDB Management Service* to the actual names


Timeline of the 3 products
--------------------------


.. only:: todo

   - find a fun theme for the 3 products: 3 amigos?
   - draw a timeline showing the 3 main features: monitoring, backup, automation


Under the hood, comparing the products
--------------------------------------

- common

  - the *monitoring*, *automation* and *backup* agents

- different

  - who pay$ who
  - hosts where you run *MongoDB*
  - no SSH access in *Atlas*


The main components of Ops Manager
----------------------------------

.. note::

   - we use *Ops Manager*, however it is very similar for *Cloud Manager* and *Atlas*.


The MMS Agents
--------------

- monitoring

  - always required, reports detailed status on cluster
  - collect ``mongod/mongos`` stats
  - usually 1 active at any time, the other ones in stand-by

    - the monitoring agent needs connectivity to all ``mongod/mongos`` to monitor

- automation

  - optional, only if you want to *manage* your deployment
  - collect additional hardware stats
  - one per host


.. nextslide::

- backup

  - optional, only if you want to backup
  - piggyback on the information from the monitoring agent
  - usually 1 active at any time, the other ones in stand-by

.. only:: instructor

   .. note::

      - common mistake to expect each monitoring agent to monitor only the lost host


Communication between the agents and the servers
------------------------------------------------

- The agents **always initiate** the communication

  - monitoring agent: give me the list of hosts/ports to monitor
  - automation agent: give me the configuration of what I should see on this host
  - backup agent: give me the list of hosts to do initial sync, or get *oplog* entries from


Communication between the monitoring agents and the processes
-------------------------------------------------------------

.. include:: /images/cm-monitoring-agents.rst


How is monitoring done?
-----------------------

- run:

  - ``serverStatus()``
  - optionally ``dbStats()``


How is automation done?
-----------------------

- receive a *desired state* for all processes
- detect a *current state* for processes
- do

  - start/stop processes
  - change configuration files
  - install MongoDB versions

- ... until *desired state* is reached
- also collect hardware metrics

.. only:: instructor

   .. note::

      - any manual changes to the configuration from the shell, to the config files, ... is likely to be reversed.


How are backups done in Ops Manager?
------------------------------------


.. only:: instructor

   .. note::

      - the students should have seen the 2 videos on backup from the on-line classes
      - go over the questions they have, however the sizing exercise in the next slides will be a good recap.


How much does it cost to backup in Ops Manager
----------------------------------------------

- We have 5 shards of 1 TB each. How much disk space if:

  - using a *Blockstore Database*
  - using *File System Snapshots*

.. only:: instructor

   .. note::

      - [DRAW] to flow of data from a sharded cluster to an *Ops Manager* deployment


How does Ops Manager manage disk space
--------------------------------------

- *Blockstore* mode
- *File System Snapshots* mode


Typical deployments of Ops Manager
----------------------------------


How do you monitor/backup/manage your clusters
----------------------------------------------

- how many MMS groups?


Lab: deploy a cluster with Cloud Manager
----------------------------------------


Restoring a backup
------------------


Lab: restore a backup
---------------------

In this lab, you will restore a backup from *Cloud Manager* and start a MongoDB process to talk to the restored database.


Queryable backups
-----------------


Lab: query a given snapshot from Cloud Manager
----------------------------------------------


Zones
-----


Lab: deploy a cluster using zones in Atlas
------------------------------------------


.. only:: todo

   - resolve the issue where people have to provide their credit card info to access Atlas.


Lab: using the Cloud Manager UI
-------------------------------

In this exercise, you will browse the *Cloud Manager* UI in order to answer few questions.


Some details on our Cloud Manager deployment
--------------------------------------------

- `Cloud Manager Admin Console <https://cloud.mongodb.com/v2/admin#general/overview/servers>`_


Main Differences in Versions prior to 3.4
-----------------------------------------

- no server pool, provision hosts individually
- previous version of *Ops Manager* was 2.0


Common Issues
-------------

- monitoring and backup agents can't access remote processes
- undersized hardware, especially for backups
