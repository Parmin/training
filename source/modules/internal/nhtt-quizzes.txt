Assessment Quizzes
------------------

- Unless said otherwise, the questions apply only to MongoDB version 3.4
- There is stuff we don't expect you to know in those quizzes.
  Don't sweat it.
  This information is helpful to see what to cover in more
  details in this NHTT session.


Atlas, Cloud Manager and Ops Manager Assessment
-----------------------------------------------


Which of the following have you done?
-------------------------------------


Indexing Assessment
-------------------

.. only:: instructor

  .. note::

     - The old version of this Quiz is in SurveyMonkey:

       - url to take quiz: https://www.research.net/r/XGDFBJQ
       - url to edit quiz: https://www.surveymonkey.com/summary/7pFpOSfaY9uUMCZUDj2wOcgRWwBI4Mg9GNnjmSRp6ljAHTZZkWRRMM2hqSPg5sMP

        - we need a different dataset to explain equality/sort/range.
          It would be good to have 1-N relationships for each level (not a 1-1 like city to zipcode)

       - let's not use boolean fields, unless the purpose is to show low cardinality


1.
--

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.users.find( { username : <string> } )
   db.users.find( { isActive : true, username: <string> } )

.. code-block:: javascript

  { username : 1, isActive : 1 }

An alternative might be two indexes:

.. code-block:: javascript

  { username : 1 }
  { isActive : 1, username : 1 }, { partialFilterExpression : { isActive : true } }

but the overhead of maintaining two indexes might not be worth it.

.. only:: instructor

  .. note::

    - Descending is OK, too.

    - This has to be the ordering, however, because if it were { isActive : 1, username : 1 },
      then the index couldn't be used for the first query.


2.
--

.. code-block:: javascript

  db.zips.find( { city : { $in : [ <string>, <string>, <string> ] },
                  state : <string> } ).sort( { zip_code : 1 } )

Any of the following:

.. code-block:: javascript

  { state : 1, zip_code: 1, city : 1 }
  { state : 1, zip_code: 1, city : -1 }
  { state : 1, zip_code: -1, city : 1 }
  { state : 1, zip_code: -1, city : -1 }
  { state : -1, zip_code: 1, city : 1 }
  { state : -1, zip_code: 1, city : -1 }
  { state : -1, zip_code: -1, city : 1 }
  { state : -1, zip_code: -1, city : -1 }

Descending is OK too, in any or all of the fields.

The order, however, is important. State needs to come first in order to
efficiently use the index, and zip_code needs to come second in order to use
the index for the sort.


3.
--

.. code-block:: javascript

  db.accounts.updateMany( { lastLogin : { $gte : ISODate( "2016-10-01" ) },
                            isActive : true },
                          { $inc : { balanceDue : NumberDecimal(10.00) } } )

any of the following:

.. code-block:: javascript

  { isActive : 1, lastLogin : 1 }
  { isActive : 1, lastLogin : -1 }
  { isActive : -1, lastLogin : 1 }
  { isActive : -1, lastLogin : -1 }


4.
--

.. code-block:: javascript

  db.people.insertOne( { username : "will@mongodb.com", password : "12345",
                         employer : "MongoDB" } )

No index is required for this. Insertions don't benefit from indexes, and are actually slowed down by them.


5.
--

.. code-block:: javascript

  db.users.find( { isActive : true } ).sort( { lastLogin : -1, lastName : 1,
                                               firstName : 1 } )

Any of the following will work:

.. code-block:: javascript

  { isActive : 1, lastLogin : -1, lastName: 1, firstName: 1 }
  { isActive : -1, lastLogin : -1, lastName: 1, firstName: 1 }
  { isActive : 1, lastLogin : 1, lastName: -1, firstName: -1 }
  { isActive : -1, lastLogin : 1, lastName: -1, firstName: -1 }


6.
--

.. code-block:: javascript

  db.accounts.find( { accountBalance : { $gte : NumberDecimal(100000.00) } },
                      city: "New York" ).sort( { lastName: 1, firstName: 1 } )

.. code-block:: javascript

   { city: 1, lastName: 1, firstName: 1, accountBalance: 1 }

(order doesn't matter, except that lastName and firstName must be aligned).


Replication Assessment
----------------------


1. Which of the following is/are true of the Oplog?
---------------------------------------------------

- :green:`The Oplog can be transmitted from one secondary to another`
- :red:`The Oplog can be transmitted from a secondary to the primary`
- :red:`The Oplog includes all server log information`
- :red:`When 2 nodes are in sync, they contain the same last Oplog entry and the same first Oplog entry`
- :green:`Oplog entries can safely be applied more than once, but not skipped`

.. only:: instructor

  .. note::

    - 4. Oplog sizes can be different, so you would have the same end only.


2. Which of the following is/are best practice reasons to read from secondaries?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- :red:`To increase read throughput when the primary is under heavy write load`
- :green:`To offload batch processing work from the primary (e.g., data analytics)`
- :green:`To provide local reads in geographically distributed replica sets`
- :red:`The application server runs on the same host as the secondary`

.. only:: instructor

  .. note::

    - 1. all members do the same amount of writes
    - 4. that is a poor design to start with. Don't run the app on the same node as a mongod server


3. When is an election called?
------------------------------

- :red:`When a write with no known Primary comes in`
- :green:`When there is no Primary`
- :red:`When Oplog entries must be replicated`
- When no other server has called for an election

.. only:: instructor

  .. note::

    - 4. False/tricky, the fact that no server has called for an election is not enough


4. Which statements are true in MongoDB 3.4 regarding replication?
------------------------------------------------------------------

- :red:`There is a maximum of 13 voting members in a replica set`
- :green:`There is a maximum of 50 nodes in a replica set`
- :red:`Arbiters have an Oplog`
- :red:`Some nodes can have more than one vote`
- :red:`Only the members in the following states can vote: PRIMARY, SECONDARY, STARTUP2, ARBITER`

.. only:: instructor

  .. note::

    - 1. max of 7 voting nodes
    - 4. That was true in old releases (2.6?)
    - 5. STARTUP2 is invalid, need to go to the next state RECOVERING. ROLLBACK can also vote


5. The following would likely be observed if you change w=1 to w=majority
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

- :green:`Operations would take longer to complete from the client point of view`
- :red:`The Primary would process less operations per second`
- :green:`You would see an increase of active connections on the Primary`
- :red:`In a Primary/Sec/Sec/Arb/Arb config, only one secondary would have to acknowledge the write`
- :green:`Even with 25 nodes in the replica set, the server would only wait for a max of 7 nodes`

.. only:: instructor

  .. note::

    - 1. yes, waiting on confirmation from the secondaries
    - 2. the Primary is not doing addition writes, so the performance should be the same
    - 3. connections have to wait longer, so you need more of them
    - 4. arbiters also count in the nodes, even if they can't do writes. Prevents 2 arbs electing a node without the data.
    - 5. write concerns only apply to voting members, so yes 7 is the max majority possible


Security Assessment
-------------------


1. Which authentication modes are available in the MongoDB Community version
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

- :red:`Authentication through LDAP`
- :red:`Authentication through Kerberos`
- :green:`Authentication through SCRAM-SHA1`
- :green:`Authentication through x509`
- :red:`Two factor authentication`

.. only:: instructor

  .. note::

    - 1 and 2 are available in the Enterprise version


2. Which of the following are true regarding TLS/SSL and MongoDB?
-----------------------------------------------------------------

- :red:`TLS/SSL gives transport compression between the client and the server`
- :green:`TLS/SSL gives  transport encryption between the client and the server`
- :green:`TLS/SSL can help restricting which clients can connect the mongod processes`
- :green:`TLS/SSL can be deployed between the mongod processes without downtime`
- :red:`Using SSL certificates is a guarantee against man-in-the-middle attack`

.. only:: instructor

  .. note::

    - 1 most of the time you will get compression, however it is not guaranteed,
      it depends on the library
    - 5 not if you use self-signed certificates. However CA-signed certificates
      will protect against a man-in-the-middle attack


3. Which of the following represent 'authorization' actions, not 'authentication'?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- :green:`listing databases`
- :green:`creating a role`
- :red:`connecting to a mongod node`
- turning on *--auth*
- adding a user

.. only:: instructor

  .. note::

    - 4 is a little tricky. '--auth' is turning on 'authorization', however
      it will also require that you authenticate as the user before being
      able to access the resources you have been authorized to access
    - 5 is also a little tricky. You need the appropriate role (being authorized)
      to add a user, however you are adding a user that can be 'authenticated' against.


4. If I create a user with the following command, which of the following are appropriate commands?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

.. code-block:: javascript

   use db1; db.createUser({user:"me",pwd:"XXX",
            roles:[{role:"read",db:"db2"},{role:"readWrite",db:"db3"}]})

- :red:`mongo --user me --password XXX`
- :red:`use db2; db.auth("me","XXX")`
- :green:`as 'me': use db3; db.colA.findOne()`
- :red:`as 'me': use db2; db.colA.insert({fieldA:1})`
- :red:`as root user: use admin; db.getUser("me")`
- :green:`as root user: use db1; db.getUser("me")`
- :green:`as root user: use admin; db.system.users.find({user:"me"})`

.. only:: instructor

  .. note::

    - 1, you need to specify the database to authenticate against
    - 2, the user has privileges in 'db2' and 'db3', however was created in 'db1',
      so must 'authenticate' against this database
    - 4, 'me' has only 'read' access in 'db2'
    - 5, even if all users are kept in 'admin', 'getUser' only show the ones
      that are created against that database
    - 7, unlike '5', querying the 'system.users' collection will show you all users.


5. Which of the following statements are true?
----------------------------------------------

- :green:`FIPS stands for Federal Information Processing Standard`
- :green:`SCRAM stands for Salted Challenge Response Authentication Mechanism`
- :green:`HIPAA stands for Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act`
- :green:`TLS/SSL stands for Transport Layer Security/Secure Sockets Layer`
- :red:`CRUD stands for Certified Restricted User of Data`

.. only:: instructor

  .. note::

    - Hopefully no one got CRUD wrong...


Sharding Assessment
-------------------


1. You have a sharded cluster that does not perform well, what should be the first actions to take?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- :red:`Add memory to the hosts`
- :red:`Move some of your reads from the Primaries to the Secondaries`
- :red:`Replace the spinning disks with SSDs`
- :red:`Stop the balancer`
- :red:`Upgrade to the latest MongoDB version`
- :green:`Examine the distribution of writes and reads per shard`
- :green:`Review the shard key`
- :red:`Add one or more shards`

.. only:: instructor

  .. note::

    - 1. you don't know what the problem is
    - 2. Don't read from secondaries in sharded clusters!!! That should have been clear in M201.
    - 3. still need to access the root cause
    - 4. ... yes if you know that this is the problem
    - 5. That may help, but not the first thing to do
    - 8. Again, trying to fix an issue without knowing the cause


2. For MongoDB 3.4, when you perform a query on a sharded cluster that involves an explicit sort stage
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(ie, the sort isn't handled by the index ordering), where does the sorting take place?

- :green:`On those shards that contain documents to return`
- On a random shard
- :red:`On the mongos that routed your query`
- :green:`On the primary shard for the given database`

.. only:: instructor

  .. note::

    REF: https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/sharded-cluster-query-router/

    - 2. on a random shard if aggregation query
    - 3. Used to be up to 3.2. Changed in 3.4


3. You are running a 3-member replica set, with one server in each of your 3 data centers
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Which of the following are good times to shard? Check all that apply.

- :green:`Your disk I/O is limiting you. Your current servers cost $8,000 each, and replacing servers to double throughput would cost $50,000 per server.`
- :red:`You are getting a lot of page faults, are running on $500 servers and doubling the RAM on each server would cost $200.`
- :red:`You are running on servers that cost $8,000 each, and your working set fits in RAM, but you would like to increase the speed of your read queries.`


4. If the shard key is not included in a find operation on a cluster
--------------------------------------------------------------------

where there are 3 shards, each one a replica set with 5 members.
How many server processes will see the find operation?
(Do not count the mongos that routes the query.)

- :green:`3`


5. In the context of a sharded cluster, which of the following are NOT true of chunks?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- :red:`Chunks may exist that contain no documents`
- :red:`Chunk ranges are inclusive of the lower boundary and exclusive of the upper boundary`
- :green:`Documents have a metadata field referencing the chunk they belong to`
- :red:`Every chunk is assigned to a particular shard`
- :green:`The default chunk size changes automatically to meet the needs of an application`

.. only:: instructor

  .. note::

    - 3. from the value of the shard key, you would search the chunk it belongs to.
         There is no direct link, it would be too expensive to update on splits
    - 5. Default is 64MB, you must change it in the 'settings' if needed


Storage Engines Assessment
--------------------------


1. Which of the following storage engines are available in the MongoDB Community Version?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- :green:`MMAP v1 - Memory Map storage engine`
- :green:`Wired Tiger`
- :red:`Rock DB`
- :red:`TokuMX`
- :red:`In-Memory storage engine`
- :red:`column based storage engine`

.. only:: instructor

  .. note::

    - 3. is open source, mostly written by Facebook
    - 4. SE using fractal index, acquired by Percona
    - 5. is only available in the Enterprise version
    - 6. does not exist yet, however Eliot is interested in having it


2. Which of the following apply to both MMAPv1 and Wired Tiger?
---------------------------------------------------------------

- :red:`More CPU cores gives a better performance`
- :green:`Using a separate disk for the journal gives better performance`
- :red:`Support for the read concern 'majority'`
- :green:`Support for the read concern 'linearizable'`
- :red:`Native support for at rest encryption`
- :red:`Native support for on-disk compression`

.. only:: instructor

  .. note::

    - 1,3,5 and 6 are only supported by Wired Tiger
    - 5 and 6 can be achieved by third party software


3. Which of the following statements are true for Wired Tiger in MongoDB 3.4?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

- :red:`The default WT cache size is 60% minus 1GB`
- :green:`Checkpoints are created every 60 seconds and stored on disk`
- :red:`Incrementing a value on a field only result in that location being updated in memory and on disk`
- :red:`Because of checkpoints, a cursor on a query will never see newer documents as it return them`
- :green:`The file system cache is still usually important for good performance`

.. only:: instructor

  .. note::

    - 1 this was for 3.2. In 3.0 and 3.4 it is 50%-1GB.
      It highlights the difficulty we have in coming up with the right number.
    - 3 full documents are written in new area for all modification.
      The described behavior is for MMAPv1
    - 4 there is no guarantee that documents not read yet are not going to be updated.
      Cursors could take hours to go over their result set and WT does not keep many checkpoints


4. For the WiredTiger cache, which of the following represent the differences between on-disk pages and pages in the cache?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- :green:`Presence of a page-specific index`
- :green:`Compression and encryption`
- :green:`Update list`
- :red:`Ordering of documents (for a clean page)`


5. For WiredTiger, what are the differences between collections and indexes?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

- :red:`Indexes are stored in b-trees, but collections are stored in flat data structures`
- :red:`There is (almost) no difference between indexes and collections`
- :green:`An index is (usually) smaller than a collection`
- :red:`They use the same type of compression`
- :green:`Index look the same in the WT cache and memory`


Tools Assessment
----------------

1. Have you used the tools in the following manner
--------------------------------------------------

- used *mongorestore* to load data in MongoDB?
- used *mongoimport* to load data in MongoDB?
- used a tool to generate documents with a specific shape? If so, which one?
- used third party tools to manage data and clusters in MongoDB? If so, which ones?
- have pull MongoDB repositories from GitHub?
- have use the Profiler in MongoDB


2. You have a 3-member replica set, capturing time-series data and serving queries
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You find that the application sees high response time on its queries. What action should you take?

- :green:`Look up for disk saturation`
- :red:`Change the spinning disks for SSDs`
- :green:`Turn off profiling, if on`
- Look for a replication lag on the secondaries
- :red:`Move all the read queries to a secondary`

.. only:: instructor

  .. note::

    - 2. You don't even know what the problem is.
    - 4. Could be if you use w=majority, however bad design for time series
    - 5. don't scale by doing reads on secondaries
