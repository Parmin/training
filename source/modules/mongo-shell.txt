The Mongo Shell
===============

.. topic:: Learning objectives 

   Students should understand:

    - The mongo shell is a javascript shell
    - Tab to autocomplete
    - Cursors are automatically iterated
        - How to stop this
    - Find function definitions
    - Use help methods








Cursors in MongoDB
------------------

    - A find() query returns a cursor
    - A cursor is a pointer that you can iterate over, one document at a time
    - The MongoDB shell automatically iterates over the first 20 documents
    - You can avoid this auto-iteration by assigning the cursor to a variable  

Exercise: Being Explicit about Cursors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: javascript
    
    var x = db.moreStuff.find()
    x.hasNext()  // should be true
    x.next()
    x.next()
    x.next()
    x.next()
    x.hasNext()  // should be false
    x.next()  // should get us an error

Cursors in the Drivers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    - In the drivers, each language handles cursors idiomatically
    - In the drivers, iteration does not happen automatically
    - If your driver has a shell (like python does), you might want 
      to use that from time to time while learning.
