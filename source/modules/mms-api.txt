Learning Objectives
-------------------

Upon completing this module students should understand:

- Overview of the Cloud / Ops Manager API
- Sample use cases for the Cloud / Ops Manager API

What is the Cloud / Ops Manager API?
------------------------------------

Allows users to programmatically:

- Access monitoring data
- Backup functionality (request backups, change snapshot schedules, etc.)
- Automation cluster configuration (modify, view)

   .. note::

      - Open the link in a browser and walk through some of the API calls, such as monitoring stats for a group


Sample API Uses Cases
---------------------

- Ingest Cloud / Ops Manager monitoring data
- Programmatically restore environments
- Configuration management

.. include:: /includes/student-notes.rst


Ingest Monitoring Data
----------------------

The monitoring API can be used to ingest monitoring data into another system, such as Nagios, HP OpenView, or your own internal dashboard.

   .. note::

      - Most large companies use other systems for monitoring, point out how the  API can help here


Programatically Restore Environments
------------------------------------

Use the backup API to programmatically restore an integration or testing environment based on the last production snapshot.

.. include:: /includes/student-notes.rst

.. only:: instructor

   .. note::

      - Fairly common practice for DBAs, except a lot of them are doing this manually


Configuration Management
------------------------

Use the automation API to integrate with existing configuration management tools (such as Chef or Puppet) to automate creating and maintaining environments.
