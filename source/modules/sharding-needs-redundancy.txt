=====================
Sharding - Redundancy
=====================


Learning Objectives
-------------------

Upon completing this module, students should understand:

- Why sharding increases the need for redundancy
- How to solve this problem


Sharding Multiplies the Dangers of Server Problems
--------------------------------------------------

- If you have 1 server, and it goes down once per year, and it takes you a week to resolve the problems that arise, it should be doable.
- If you have 100 of those servers, then you will have a server go down about twice per week, and even if you spend all of your time resolving the issues that arise, you will never get it all done.
- To prevent this from happening in MongoDB, you need to make sure each shard is a replica set.

Using Replica Sets Solves the Problem
-------------------------------------

- If each node is a replica set, your data will be as safe as you need it to be.

  - Failover is handled automatically, and quickly.
  - Rollback can be prevented if the replica set is properly configured.

- For more redundancy, add more replica set members and keep them distributed.
