Replica Sets and Performance

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Learning Objectives
-------------------

Upon completing this module, students should be able to:

- Define write concern, read preference, read concern, and linearizable writes
- Evaluate the performance tradeoffs that occur with increased durability guarantees

.. include:: /modules/replica-set-write-concern.txt
   :start-after: .. BEGIN DEFINING WRITE CONCERN
   :end-before: .. END DEFINING WRITE CONCERN

.. include:: /modules/performance.txt
   :start-after: .. BEGIN WRITE CONCERN PERFORMANCE
   :end-before: .. END WRITE CONCERN PERFORMANCE

.. include:: /modules/replica-set-read-preference.txt
   :start-after: .. BEGIN READ PREFERENCE CONTENT
   :end-before: .. END READ PREFERENCE CONTENT

.. include:: /modules/replica-set-read-concern.txt
   :start-after: .. BEGIN READ CONCERN CONTENT
   :end-before: .. END LINEARIZABLE CONTENT


Replica Sets and Performance
----------------------------

.. rst-class:: longlist

- You must balance performance costs against read/write guarantees
- Write concern and read concern allow you to set this
- Use the weakest guarantee your application can tolerate
- Think about technical ways to get by with weaker guarantees
