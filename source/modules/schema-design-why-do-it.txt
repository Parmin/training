====================================
Underlying Reasons for Schema Design
====================================

Learning Objectives
-------------------

Upon completing this module, students will be able to:

- Explain what good schema design minimizes
- Evaluate how different schemas will affect performance

Why Learn Schema Design?
------------------------

- The structure of data affects performance.
- A good schema can mean the difference between doing many queries, or few.
- It can make the difference between having data in RAM, or touching the disk.
- It can mean the difference between having a data store that scales out, and one that doesn't.

What Affects the Speed of Reading Data?
---------------------------------------

- A server is limited in its RAM

  - Going to disk is slower

- Queries take time to make a round trip

  - Serial round trips are even worse

- Writing to disk takes time
- Different schemas will produce different bottlenecks

Goal: Minimize your Number of Queries
-------------------------------------

- Queries take a finite amount of time

  - Especially if you need to make round-trips

- Fewer queries for all the data is a net win
- Good schema design tries to minimize the number of queries
- Data that gets queried together should be stored in the same document

  .. note::

    - Round trip example:
    
      - the application queries the "books" collection and finds a document that includes an "author_id"
      - the application queries for the "authors" collection based on that "author_id" to find out more
      - Improve this by putting all the author information you need into the book


Goal: Avoid Touching Data you Won't Use
---------------------------------------

- Documents in RAM will get queried faster than documents not in RAM
- The same is true of indexes
- RAM is measured in bytes
- Bytes of data you're not using will push out bytes of data you are

Goal: Avoid Touching Data you Won't Use (cont'd)
------------------------------------------------

- Don't put data into documents if you won't use it
- Push rarely-used data into a different collection

  - This allows you to store more documents in RAM

- Make use of covered queries

  - The fastest read is the one that can be answered by the index

What to Prioritize
------------------

- Prioritize for your most common queries

  - Optimizing these at the expense  of others is a net win

- The patterns you see today are ways of prioritizing different operations
- Your schema depends on your access patterns.
- To figure out what you need, start by writing your queries. *Then* arrange
  the data so that they're answered efficiently.

Summary
-------

- Minimize your number of queries
- Minimize your document size
- Optimize your most common use cases
- Write your queries first to determine what to prioritize
