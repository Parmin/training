Query Operators
===============


Learning Objectives
-------------------

Upon completing this module students should understand the following types of MongoDB query operators:

- Comparison operators
- Logical operators
- Element query operators
- Operators on arrays


Comparison Query Operators
--------------------------

- ``$lt``: Exists and is less than
- ``$lte``: Exists and is less than or equal to
- ``$gt``: Exists and is greater than
- ``$gte``: Exists and is greater than or equal to
- ``$ne``: Does not exist or does but is not equal to
- ``$in``: Exists and is in a set
- ``$nin``: Does not exist or is not in a set

Logical Query Operators
-----------------------

- ``$or``: Match either of two or more values
- ``$not``: Used with other operators
- ``$nor``: Match neither of two or more values
- ``$and``: Match both of two or more values 

  - This is the default behavior for queries specifying more than one condition.
  - Use $and if you need to include the same operator more than once in a query.

Element Query Operators
-----------------------

- $exists: Returns the document if the field is present or not.
- $type: Returns the document if the field is of the given type or not.
- See :manual:`BSON types</reference/bson-types>` for reference on types.

Array Query Operators
---------------------

- ``$all``: Array field must contain all values listed.
- ``$size``: Array must have a particular size. 

  - E.g., $size : 2 means 2 elements in the array

- ``$elemMatch``: All conditions must be matched by at least one element in the array
