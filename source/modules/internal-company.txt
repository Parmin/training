Open Source Model
-----------------

- `Open Source` is more to protect us and our customers than to accept contributions

  - *MongoDB Inc* is the sole copyright holder of the source code

- A third party can not distribute our binaries without the source code and they can't sell licenses of MongoDB
- AGPL

.. include:: /includes/student-notes.rst

    questions to ask
    - What is AGPL? Affero General Public License
      - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affero_General_Public_License

    - What does it mean that third party can't distribute our binaries? What if they are included on their software?

    - If I embed MongoDB on a binary? is this a violation of our license?
      - No, but they cannot sell support on that component of their product. Generally we will get a OEM license model for these situations
