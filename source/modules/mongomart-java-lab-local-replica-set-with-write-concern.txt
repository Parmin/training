Lab: Use a Local Replica Set with a Write Concern
=================================================


Description
-----------

- It is important to use replication for production MongoDB instances, however, Lab 1 advised us to use a standalone server.
- Convert your local standalone mongod instance to a three node replica set named "shard1".
- Modify MongoMart's MongoDB connection string to include at least two nodes from the replica set.
- Modify your application's write concern to MAJORITY for all writes to the "cart" collection.
- Any writes to the "item" collection should continue using the default write concern of W:1
