Learning Objectives 
-------------------

Upon completing this module students should understand:

- Ops Manager overview
- Ops Manager components
- Considerations for sizing an Ops Manager environment

MongoDB Ops Manager
-------------------

- On-premises version of MMS
- Everything stays within private network

.. include:: /includes/student-notes.rst
  
Ops Manager Components
----------------------

- Application server(s): web interface
- Monitoring databases: all monitoring metrics
- Backup infrastructure: cluster backups and restores
  
.. include:: /includes/student-notes.rst

Ops Manager Architecture
------------------------

.. only:: instructor

   .. note::

      - Theese deployments can get complex, talk about all the pieces
      - Multiple backup daemons/blockstores for large clusters


Ops Manager Application Server
------------------------------

- 15GB RAM, 50GB of disk space are required
- Equivalent to a m3.xlarge AWS instance
  
.. include:: /includes/student-notes.rst

Ops Manager Monitoring Database
-------------------------------

- All monitoring metrics stored here
- Replica set, however, a standalone MongoDB node can also be used
  
.. include:: /includes/student-notes.rst

Ops Manager Backup Infrastructure
---------------------------------

- Blockstore database
- Backup daemon process (manages applying oplog entries, creating snapshots, etc.)

.. include:: /includes/student-notes.rst

Blockstore Database
-------------------

- Replica set, a standalone MongoDB node can also be used
- Must be sized carefully
- All snapshots are stored here
- Block level de-duping, the same block isn't stored twice (significantly reduces database size for deployment with low/moderate writes)

.. include:: /includes/student-notes.rst

Backup Daemon Process
---------------------

- The "workhorse" of the backup infrastructure
- Creates a local copy of the database it is backing up (references "HEAD" database)
- Requires 2-3X data space (of the database it is backing up)
- Can run multiple daemons, pointing to multiple blockstores (for large clusters)
