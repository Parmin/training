==========================
Architecture (Ops Manager)
==========================


Learning Objectives
-------------------

Upon completing this module students should understand:

- Ops Manager overview
- Ops Manager components
- Considerations for sizing an Ops Manager environment

MongoDB Ops Manager
-------------------

- On-premises version of Cloud Manager
- Everything stays within private network

.. include:: /includes/student-notes.rst


Components
----------

- Application server(s): web interface
- Ops Manager application database: monitoring metrics, automation configuration, etc.
- Backup infrastructure: cluster backups and restores

.. include:: /includes/student-notes.rst

.. only:: instructor

   .. note::

      - These deployments can get complex, talk about all the pieces
      - Multiple backup daemons/backup DBs for large clusters


Application Server
------------------

- 15GB RAM, 50GB of disk space are required
- Equivalent to a m3.xlarge AWS instance

.. include:: /includes/student-notes.rst


Application Database
--------------------

- All monitoring metrics, automation configurations, etc. stored here
- Replica set, however, a standalone MongoDB node can also be used

.. include:: /includes/student-notes.rst


Backup Infrastructure
---------------------

- Backup database (blockstore, oplog, sync)
- Backup daemon process (manages applying oplog entries, creating snapshots, etc.)

.. include:: /includes/student-notes.rst


Backup Database
---------------

- 3 sections:
  - blockstore for blocks
  - oplog
  - sync for initial sync slices
- Replica set, a standalone MongoDB node can also be used
- Must be sized carefully
- All snapshots are stored here
- Block level de-duping, the same block isn't stored twice (significantly reduces database size for deployment with low/moderate writes)

.. include:: /includes/student-notes.rst


Backup Daemon Process
---------------------

- The "workhorse" of the backup infrastructure
- Creates a local copy of the database it is backing up (references "HEAD" database)
- Requires 2-3X data space (of the database it is backing up)
- Can run multiple daemons, pointing to multiple backup databases (for large clusters)
