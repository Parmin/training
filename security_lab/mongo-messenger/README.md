Mongo Messenger
===============

This is an example Node.js application using MongoDB. This app is designed to
be apart of an NHTT security lab.

Getting Started
---------------

```bash
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

It will take up to a minute for the server to start running. From there you can
visit the app at [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

Updating the connection to MongoDB
----------------------------------

During the course of the security lab you'll need to update the code that
connects to MongoDB. You can do that via the `lib/messages.js` file.
