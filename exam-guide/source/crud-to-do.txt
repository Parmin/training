Steps:

0. Put objectives.
  - First draft:
    - On the certification exam, you will be expected to:
      - Understand everything in the CRUD outline below
      - Be able to select the correct CRUD input to accomplish an operation described
      - Be able to look at an CRUD operation and choose the correct plaintext description for what it does
      - Differentiate between valid and invalid CRUD inputs
      - Determine, for a given collection:
        - What documents will be returned by a .find() query and what form they'll be in
        - What documents will be written to, and what they will look like after an update or delete operation
        - What might prevent an insert from working properly
1. Describe what the CRUD section covers, in a broad overview.
2. Give an approximate range of how much of the exam is going to be CRUD (ie, "approximately 20-40%")
  - for devs
  - for DBAs

3. Present the outline of the CRUD section (i'm just going to put it here, b/c copy/paste is easy):
  - I may want to put the outline first, before the description & what not.

- Create
- Read
  - Matching
  - Projecting
  - Sorting
  - matching & projection operators
  - regex
- Update
  - Standard update
  - Multi update
  - upsert
  - save
- Delete
  - db.collection.remove()
  - db.collection.drop()
- Cursors
  - getMore

4. For each section, go through the topics, mention if they are a big part of the section (which is the case for .update and .finds), and point to:
  - a YouTube url from the courseware
  - a page of the docs
  - If it's a large section, such as for operators, there may be lots of links

5. Close with an overall review of the major CRUD concepts they should be practicing, such as:
  - Matching (for find, update, and delete)
  - Projection (find)
  - Update document (ie, the second document in db.collection.update({match}, {update})

6. Come back later to input some example problems.
