Philosophy and Features
-----------------------

On the certification exam, we will attempt to verify that you:
- Know and can define the biggest features of MongoDB 
- Understand JSON and BSON at a basic level

Philosophy and Features Subtopics
---------------------------------

- JSON
- BSON
- Fault tolerance
- Horizontal Scaling
- The Mongo Shell
- Basics of the MongoDB system
- Advantages of MongoDB over relational databases
- MongoDB as a "schemaless" database

Here is a white paper that touches on multiple topics_.

JSON
----

The JSON spec is pretty basic; you should know:
- All JSON types
- The structure of JSON objects and arrays
- How to nest JSON objects, arrays, and other types

Here are some good resources:
- JSON video lessons
  - Intro to JSON_
  - JSON revisited_
  - JSON subdocuments_
  - JSON spec_
- JSON web or pdf literature:
  - json.org_
  - Document databases_

.. _json.org: http://json.org/
.. _Document databases: https://www.mongodb.com/document-databases
.. _Intro to JSON: http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/reference/mongodb-extended-json/
.. _JSON revisited: http://youtu.be/CTffxoSSLqg
.. _JSON subdocuments: http://youtu.be/vrYAEH3g13M
.. _JSON spec: http://youtu.be/kOrsT94-A28

BSON
----

The following should help elucidate BSON a bit:

- Text/web resources:
  - BSON spec_
- Other resources;
  - Bsondump_ (you can point it at MongoDB data files if you're using MMAPv1)

.. _BSON spec: http://bsonspec.org/  
.. _BSONdump: http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/reference/program/bsondump/

a. Replication
b. Sharding
c. The proper storage engine

e. Put indexes on all of your documents

3. What are the uses of the mongo shell? Check all that apply.
