Application and Server Administration (DBA Only)
------------------------------------------------

For the Certification Exam, students will be expected to:

- Understand the purpose of the journal, the log, and security.
- Know the advantages/disadvantages of different cluster architecture options.
- Be able to evaluate options about basic server diagnostics, maintenance, backup, and disaster recovery.

Application and Server Administration Introduction
--------------------------------------------------

While the definitions are somewhat fluid, Application Administration deals with MongoDB's relationship to applications. Since MongoDB is a flexible data store, it's basically never used alone, except for training purposes. It's always hooked into an application, and this requires a certain set of features to assist with the interface, such as the wire protocol, over-the-wire encryption, and security. 

Server administration deals with all other aspects of architecting, maintaining, or repairing the server system. While Sharding and Replication are big enough to merit their own sections in the exam, this should cover almost everything else.


Journal
-------

MongoDB's journal is a "write ahead" log used to ensure consistency of data on disk for MMAPv1 (though it's not necessary for WiredTiger), and also is used to frequently commit writes to disk.

Server Logs
-----------

The server logs capture several things by default: connections, the creation/dropping of collections/databases, and long-running events (more than 100 ms), for example.

Further Exercises
-----------------

- Create a replica set or sharded cluster. Create a database, and then drop it. Put the server under a simulated load, and then insert an array of large documents (~15 MB), preferably as a bulk insert. Check the server logs and try to find the long-running events.
