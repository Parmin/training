Storage Engines
---------------

By the end of this module, students will know:

- The locking level or concurrency protocols for each storage engine
- The compression algorithms available for each storage engine
- For MMAPv1, the causes & effects of document movement
- The effects of these features on the performance of MongoDB

Storage Engine Considerations for Data Modeling
-----------------------------------------------

Your data model can be affected by your choice of storage engine. For example, if you are using MMAPv1, you will need to worry about document movement in a way that doesn't affect WiredTiger. WiredTiger also has document-level concurrency (vs. Collection-level locking for MMAPv1) that can allow you to perform more operations in parallel.

WiredTiger also offers data compression, which can dramatically reduce disk I/O for compressible data.
