ssh -v -i ~/Downloads/AdvancedOpsTraining.pem ec2-user@ec2-54-82-187-170.compute-1.amazonaws.com

2. Connect to each instance and setup first exercise

cd scripts/Replication
./premise-3.sh



** EXERCISES AND SCHEDULE **


-- 6AM (9AM EST)

1. Send details on how to connect to each team, include:

-- 6:15AM (6:15AM EST)

2. Upgrade running replica set

"MongoDB releases a new version. How do we upgrade our production systems with minimal downtime?"

PREP: ~/scripts/Replication/premise-1-2.sh


-- 7AM (10AM EST)

3. Fix recovering secondary

"There is secondary stuck in the "RECOVERING STATE", fix the recovering secondary to create a healthy 3 node replica set."

PREP: ~/scripts/Replication/premise-3.sh


-- 9AM (11AM EST)

4. The system is slow, there are exactly 5 things wrong, identify and fix them (3 can be fixed from the server, 2 from the developer)

PREP:

/home/ec2-user/new/bin/mongoimport -d twitter -c tweets /home/ec2-user/scripts/Perf/twitter.json

from local machine:
python bad_queries.py (located in scripts/Perf)


-- 11AM (1PM EST)

5. Point in time recovery

"I thought I was on my development machine and I've accidentally dropped a collection in production."

The backup system captured its most recent backup last night, which is in the /home/ec2-user/scripts/dump directory, but the system continued to recover data through the night. You need to restore your data to the point in time just before the you dropped the collection.

The collection is test.users and the total number of documents prior to the drop was 20,000.
